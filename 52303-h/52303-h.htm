  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Although this History of Lumsden’s Horse embraces a period
in the South African campaign that was crowded with great
issues, it makes no pretence to rank among the many able and
comprehensive works dealing with those events. Elaborate
descriptions and criticisms of operations as a whole have been
purposely avoided, except so far as they serve to explain and
emphasise actions in which the corps took part.</p>

<p class='c000'>First of all, the book is intended to be no more than a
regimental record, enlivened by the personal experiences of men
who helped to make history at a time when the whole British
Empire was moved by one impulse. India’s part in that
movement is the inspiring theme, and one object has been to
show how the idea of organising an Indian Volunteer Contingent
for service in South Africa passed from inception to accomplishment,
through the efforts of a Committee in Calcutta which
made itself responsible for every financial liability in connection
with the corps from its formation to its disbandment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of publication is being defrayed out of a balance
of funds remaining in the hands of the Committee, and each
member of the corps will receive a copy as a souvenir of his
interesting experiences and a proof that his services are still
remembered. Publication, however, is not restricted to members
of the corps, and the Editor ventures to think that this book will
suggest to general readers many points worthy of consideration.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>It illustrates the facility with which British subjects in India
are able to band themselves together, and affords yet another
instance of many in which the Indian Government has shown
itself capable of utilising instantly its resources for the Empire’s
benefit. And, more than this, it will stand as a proof of the
cordiality with which the Indian public—British and Native—came
forward at a time of Imperial need with offers of personal
service or liberal subscriptions, which enabled the Committee to
raise and despatch a Mounted Contingent completely equipped
in every detail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among those who have assisted the Editor with information
that has enabled him to produce this History, he has especially
to thank the Committee, the Adjutant of the Regiment (Major
<span class='sc'>Neville Taylor</span>, 14th Bengal Lancers), whose sketch-map of the
positions at Houtnek was made from personal reconnaissance,
and Messrs. <span class='sc'>D.S. Fraser</span>, <span class='sc'>Graves</span>, <span class='sc'>Burn-Murdoch</span>, <span class='sc'>Kirwan</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Preston</span>. He is also indebted to Major Ross, C.B., Durham
Light Infantry, for interesting material. Acknowledgment is due
to Messrs. <span class='sc'>Johnston &amp; Hoffmann</span>, Messrs. <span class='sc'>F. Kapp &amp; Co.</span>, Messrs.
<span class='sc'>Bourne &amp; Shepherd</span>, and Messrs. <span class='sc'>Harrington &amp; Co.</span>, of Calcutta,
and others, who have kindly placed photographs at the Editor’s
disposal; and to the proprietors of the ‘Englishman,’ ‘Pioneer,’
‘Indian Daily News,’ ‘Statesman,’ ‘Times of India,’ and
‘Madras Daily Mail,’ for permission to reproduce from their
columns the personal narratives that brighten many pages of
this book.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>To Lumsden’s Horse belongs the high honour of having represented
all India in a movement the magnitude and far-reaching
effects of which we are only beginning to appreciate.
While the stubborn struggle for supremacy in South Africa
lasted, no true sons of the Empire allowed themselves to count
the cost. Some were prepared to pay it in blood, others in
treasure, to make success certain, and none allowed himself to
harbour even the shadow of a thought that failure, with all its
inevitable disasters, could befall us so long as the Mother
Country and her offshoots held together. At the outset only
those blessed with exceptional foresight could have believed in
the completeness of a federation the elements of which were
bound together by no other ties than sentiment. Selfish interests
were merged in combined efforts for the common weal, and,
while the necessity for action lasted, few cared to reckon the
price they were paying for an idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even the long-looked-for advent of Peace has hardly brought
home to us a knowledge of all that War in South Africa meant,
not only in a military sense, but also in its greater imperial
significance. The men who fought and bled for the noble
sentiment of British brotherhood never dreamed that they were
doing more than duty demanded, though they had perhaps
given up every chance of success in life to answer the call of
patriotism; and among those who stayed at home there are
millions untouched by the bitterness of personal bereavement
who can have no conception of the sacrifices that were made to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>keep our Empire whole. Casualty lists, with all their details of
killed and wounded, do not tell half the story. To know it all
we must dip deep into the private records of every contingent,
British and Colonial, that volunteered for active service, and
deeper still to fathom the motives of men who, when their
country seemed to need them, threw aside all other considerations
and rallied to her standard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continental critics may sneer at us for making much of this
idea, but none know better than they do the difference between
loyalty expressed in such a noble form and the mere instinct of
self-preservation that too often passes current for patriotism.
They tell us that it is every citizen’s duty to be a soldier and
every soldier’s duty to die, if necessary, for his country; but
when they see self-governing nations from every quarter of
the world coming into line by their own free will and all welded
together by one sentiment, they have no better name for it than
lust of empire. Nevertheless, they know it for what it is, a
thing of which they had previously no conception, and they
recognise in the impulses that led to this mighty manifestation
the secret of Great Britain’s world-wide power. Let envious
rivals say what they will. Let them magnify our reverses and
minimise our triumphs, if the process pleases them. In spite of
everything, the South African War stands a great epoch of an
age that will some day come to be reckoned among the greatest
in British History, and all who have helped towards the shaping
of events at this memorable time can at least claim to have
earned the gratitude of posterity.</p>

<p class='c000'>And India may well be proud of her share in the work.
Measured by the mere number of men whom she sent to the war,
her contribution seems perhaps comparatively small; but when
we remember the sources from which that contingent was drawn,
the munificence of gifts from Europeans and natives alike for its
equipment and maintenance, and all the sacrifices that war-service
involved for every member of the little force, we cannot
but admire the spirit that called it into being. A great crisis
was not necessary to convince us that British residents in India
would fight, if called upon, with all the valour that distinguished
Outram’s Volunteers of old. Few, however, would have been
bold enough to predict that for any conceivable cause hundreds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of men would readily relinquish all that they had struggled for,
give up the fruits of half a life’s labour, and calmly face the
certainty of irreparable losses, without asking for anything in
return, except the opportunity of serving their country on a
soldier’s meagre pay. Still less could anybody have imagined
that a time might come when Indian natives, debarred from
the chance of proving their loyalty by personal service, would
give without stint towards a fund for equipping a force to fight
in a distant land against the enemies of the British Raj. If
Indian princes had been permitted to raise troops for the war in
South Africa, our Eastern contingent would have numbered
thousands instead of hundreds. What natives were not allowed
to give in men they gave in cash and in substance, according to
their means, thereby showing that they were with us in a desire
to defend the Empire against any assailant. In reality this
meant more than an offer of armed forces, and to that extent it
was worthy to rank with the self-sacrifice of Anglo-Indians who
gave personal service, and thereby took upon themselves a
burden the weight of which cannot be readily estimated. It
must not be forgotten that raising a corps of Volunteers in India
is a very different matter from the enrolment of a similar force
at home, or wherever there are dense populations and ‘leisured
classes’ to be drawn upon. There are no idle men in India,
everyone having gone there to fill an appointment and earn his
livelihood. When the call came, therefore, it could only be
answered by sacrifices or not at all, and nobody is more conscious
of this fact than the man whose laconic appeal for
Volunteers brought three or four times more offers than he
could possibly accept. In his opinion ‘the men who vacated
appointments worth from 300 to 500 rupees a month and went
to fight for their country on 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> a day have given a much
larger contribution to the War Fund than they could afford.’
As an instance he mentions three members of the medical
profession, Doctors Charteris, Moorhouse, and Woollright,
each of whom threw up a lucrative practice and joined the
ranks as a trooper. These are not exceptional but simply
typical cases. Scores of other men gave up equally remunerative
appointments with the same noble unselfishness to enrol
themselves in Lumsden’s Horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>To Colonel Lumsden alone belongs the honour of having
evoked this splendid manifestation of patriotic feeling. The idea
of forming a corps of Indian Volunteers was his; and though
similar thoughts may have been in many minds at the same
moment, nobody had given a practical turn to them until his
message—electric in every sense—startled all Anglo-Indians
into active and cordial co-operation. How all that came about
will be told with fuller circumstances in its proper place, but
some reference must be made here to the man whose firm faith
in the patriotism and soldierly qualities of Indian Volunteers
led him to the inception of a scheme which events have so
abundantly justified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant-Colonel Dugald McTavish Lumsden, C.B., needs
no introduction to the East, where the best, and perhaps the
happiest, years of his life have been spent. Without some details
concerning him, however, completeness could not be claimed for
any record of the corps which is now identified with his name.
The eldest son of the late Mr. James Lumsden, of Peterhead,
Aberdeenshire, he was born in 1851. At the age of twenty-two
he obtained an appointment on the Borelli Tea Estate, in the
Tezpur District of Assam, and sailed for India. Consciously or
unconsciously, he must have taken with him some military
ambitions imbibed through intimate association with leaders of
the Volunteer movement in Scotland. At any rate, he soon
became known as a keen Volunteer in the land of his adoption,
and when in 1887 the Durrung Mounted Rifles was formed, he
was given a captaincy. A year later that corps lost its identity,
as other local units did, in the territorial title of Assam Valley
Light Horse, with Colonel Buckingham, C.I.E., as commandant,
while Captain Lumsden got his majority and took command of
F Squadron in the Durrung District. Subsequently he commanded
the regiment for a time, and, though he left India in
1893, he did not lose touch with his old comrades. Every year
he returned to spend the cold weather among his friends in
Assam, showing always undiminished interest in the welfare of
his old regiment. Thus, when the time came for a call to active
service, he had no sort of doubt what the response would be from
the hardy, sport-loving planters of Northern Bengal. Himself
an enthusiastic <em>shikari</em> and first-rate shot, he knew how to value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the qualities that are developed in hunting and stalking wild
game. And his experience of Indian Volunteers was not confined
to his own district. He knew every corps in Bengal by
reputation, and could thus gauge with an approach to accuracy
the numbers on which he would be able to draw for the formation
of an Indian contingent. Much travel in many lands had
also made him a good judge of men, as evidenced by the first
thing he did when the idea of calling upon India to take up her
share of the Imperial burden came to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time he was travelling in Australia, and had no
means of knowing how deeply the feelings of British residents
and natives of the East had been stirred by news of the reverses
to our arms in South Africa. The dark days of Stormberg and
Magersfontein had thrown their shadow over Australia as over
England, chilling the hearts of people who until then had refused
to believe that British troops could be baulked by any foes,
notwithstanding the stern lesson of Ladysmith’s investment.
Through that darkness they were groping sullenly towards the
light, and wondering what national sacrifices would have to be
made before the humiliation could be wiped out. It is in such
moments of emergency that natural leaders come to the front.
Among the few in England or the Colonies who realised the
military value of Volunteers was Colonel Lumsden. Though
thousands of miles away from the scenes of early associations, his
thoughts turned at once to the bold riders and skilful marksmen
with whom he had so often shared the exciting incidents of
the chase. He made up his mind at once that the planters, on
whose spirit he could rely, were the very men wanted for South
African fighting. On the parade ground they might not be all
that soldiers whose minds are fettered by rules and traditions
would desire, but he knew how long days of exercise in the open
air at their ordinary avocations, varied by polo, pig-sticking,
and big-game hunting, had toughened their fibre and hardened
their nerves. He could count on every one of them also for
keen intelligence, which he rightly regarded as more important
than mere obedience to orders, where every man might be called
upon to think and act for himself. Colonel Lumsden would be
the last to depreciate Regular soldiers, or undervalue their discipline,
but experience had taught him that men who can exercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>self-restraint and develop powers of endurance for the mere
pleasure of excelling in manly sports, adapt themselves readily
enough to military duties. To them, at any rate, the prospect
of hardships or privations would be no deterrent, the imminence
of danger only an additional incentive. On December 15, 1899—a
day to be afterwards borne in mournful memory—Colonel
Lumsden made up his mind that the time for action had come to
every Briton who could see his way to giving the Mother Country
a helpful hand. He cabled at once to his friend Sir Patrick
Playfair in Calcutta his proposal to raise a corps of European
Mounted Infantry for service in South Africa, and backed it
with an offer, not only to take the field himself, but to contribute
a princely sum in aid of a fund for equipping any force the
Government might sanction. Then, without waiting to know
whether his services had been accepted, he took passage by the
next steamer for India.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>These were the stirring words of Colonel Lumsden’s laconic
message flashed by cable from Australia to Calcutta at a time
when all India was ripe for any movement in aid of the Empire,
and only waiting for a lead in the course it should take. No
wonder that the spirit of a man whose enthusiastic confidence
was expressed in an offer so munificent communicated itself to
all whom Sir Patrick Playfair consulted on the subject. Still,
official susceptibilities, ever prone to look askance at anything
that seems like civilian interference with military prerogatives,
had to be considered. Tact was necessary at the very outset
to avoid all possibility of friction. Colonel Lumsden had
evidently foreseen this when he selected as the recipient of his
cable message an Anglo-Indian of diplomatic temperament, great
social influence, and varied experience. Few men, if any, could
have been better qualified for the delicate negotiations, or
could have appealed to the Indian public, Native and European,
with more certainty of success than Sir Patrick Playfair, whose
services then and for months afterwards entitle him to a niche
in India’s Walhalla beside the founder of Lumsden’s Horse.
Even at the sacrifice of continuity, it is appropriate to quote
here an appreciative comment by one who knew how much Sir
Patrick Playfair did towards the formation and equipment of a
thoroughly representative force. From the moment of receiving
Colonel Lumsden’s telegram he displayed the keenest interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in its object, and endeavoured to ensure a successful issue with
all the energy that has characterised him in his advocacy and
support of many public enterprises during a brilliant career.
He was the prime mover in every social function organised in
honour of Lumsden’s Horse, and in everything done for their
benefit apart from military details while they remained in India.
After their departure for the front he never lost an opportunity
of identifying himself with them in every way, and none would
have been keener than he to share their dangers and hardships
if his position had enabled him to accompany them. In this
connection Sir Patrick had an entertaining dialogue one day
with General Patterson, of the United States army, who said,
‘What I have been wondering about is why you did not go
yourself, Sir Patrick.’ To this the knight replied, ‘Well, you
know, I am a busy man. Of course I should have liked to go
above all things, but with my engagements it was impossible.’
‘Ah, yes!’ said the General; ‘I guess you’re like Artemus
Ward’s friend, the Baldinsville editor, who would “delight to
wade in gore,” but whose country bade him stay at home and
announce week by week the measures taken by Government, or,
like Artemus himself, who, having given two cousins to the war,
was ready to sacrifice his wife’s brother and shed the blood of all
his able-bodied relations “rather’n not see the rebellyin krusht.”’
As it was, Sir Patrick took the pains to publish every item of
interest sent to him by the officer commanding throughout the
campaign. When, after twelve months of honourable service,
the corps turned homewards again, he took the initiative in preparing
a welcome worthy of them, and after Lumsden’s Horse
had been disbanded he showed a kindly interest in the men by
endeavouring to procure appointments for all who needed assistance
of that kind, and thereby won their gratitude as he had
long before gained their esteem. This is anticipating events,
but, like the prologue to a play, it may help to give some idea of
a character whose influence on the whole story is potent though
not often in evidence.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Elliott &amp; Fry</em></span><br />CURZON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Sir Patrick Playfair’s first step was to approach General
<a id='corr8.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='P.T. Maitland'>P.J. Maitland</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_8.37'><ins class='correction' title='P.T. Maitland'>P.J. Maitland</ins></a></span>, C.B., Military Secretary to the Government of
India, to whom he made known Colonel Lumsden’s offer and
explained something of its probable scope. General Maitland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>who warmly supported the proposal, said he would place it before
His Excellency the Viceroy, but intimated that the matter
would then have to be referred to the War Office, without whose
consent the Government of India could do nothing in connection
with the war. At that time Colonel Lumsden was on his way
to Calcutta, and had telegraphed again from Albany to find out
what progress was being made, but got no answer. Sir Patrick,
knowing his man, had no misgivings that he might turn back
discouraged by the prospect of an official cold shoulder. Lord
Curzon was still absent from Calcutta on tour, and the Commander-in-Chief,
the late Sir William Lockhart, had not returned
from his official round of inspection in Burma, so that no
immediate opportunity occurred for placing the proposal before
either of them at a personal interview. General Maitland, however,
did more than he had promised by so urging the case in
a communication to the Viceroy that His Excellency took it up,
and immediately on his arrival in Calcutta telegraphed to the
Commander-in-Chief, who thereupon gave his approval promptly.
The headquarters authorities asked how many men were to go,
and Sir Patrick said he thought from two hundred and fifty to
three hundred. That suggestion was embodied in a telegram to
the War Office, which, as usual, took time to consider it. Again
Colonel Lumsden, who had then reached Colombo, cabled for
information as to the state of affairs, but again no reply was
vouchsafed. So he came on, fully prepared to meet disappointment
at the end of his journey. When he got within sight of
land, however, all India knew of his splendid offer and its acceptance
by the Home Government. The whole story had been
published in every newspaper two days before Colonel Lumsden
steamed up the Hooghly to find himself a hero. Crowds of his
friends and admirers were there to welcome him as chief of
a corps that had neither a local habitation nor a name, nor even
a substantial existence at the moment. With characteristic
abnegation of self, he had offered his services in any capacity,
but nobody doubted from the hour of his arrival in Calcutta
that whatever force India might send to the front would have
Lumsden for its leader. The newspapers even began to give
his name to the contingent before it had assumed bodily shape
or anybody knew exactly how it was to be raised. Some days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>later the popular choice was confirmed by publication of a War
Office order couched in the following words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'><a id='corr12.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Her Majesty’s’'>‘Her Majesty’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_12.3'><ins class='correction' title='Her Majesty’s’'>‘Her Majesty’s</ins></a></span> Government having accepted the offer of the Government
of India to provide a force of Mounted Volunteers for service in
South Africa, two companies of Mounted Infantry, to be called the
Indian Mounted Infantry Corps (Lumsden’s Horse), will be raised
immediately at Calcutta under the command of Lieut.-Colonel D. McT.
Lumsden, of the Volunteer Force of India, Supernumerary List, Assam
Valley Light Horse.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>With this order, giving unqualified approval of the project,
came a mobilisation scheme in which the Government undertook
to provide the necessary sea-kit for use on board ship only,
the transport, the daily rations as for other soldiers, the weapons,
the munitions of war, and pay at the rate of 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> a day,
but nothing else. The rest was left to private enterprise
working on popular enthusiasm and the loyal sentiments of a
great community. Towards the sum requisite for the complete
equipment and maintenance of a mounted force in the field,
even half a lakh of rupees would not go very far. The spirit
that had prompted one man to offer that sum and his own
services to boot proved contagious, however, and Colonel
Lumsden had so little doubt what the result would be that he
immediately announced his readiness to receive applications
from men who might be willing to serve in South Africa for a
year, or ‘for not less than the period of the war.’ That call
was published by Indian newspapers on January 10, 1900, and
in response Volunteers sent their names from every district far
and near, until Colonel Lumsden might have enrolled a thousand
as easily as the two or three hundred sanctioned by Government.
His one difficulty, indeed, was that of selection, and there the
experience he had gained from studying character closely under
many different conditions came in. He was assisted by suggestions
from officers commanding the Calcutta Light Horse, the
Assam Valley Light Horse, the Surma Valley Light Horse, the
Behar Light Horse, the Punjab, the Mysore, and the Rangoon
Volunteer Corps. Authorities at home had by that time learned
a very important lesson, the outcome of which was expressed
in a phrase very different from the unlucky telegram that gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>so much offence to Australians a few weeks earlier. Colonel
Lumsden was told ‘preference will be given to Volunteers from
mounted Volunteer Corps, but Volunteers belonging to Infantry
corps who may possess the requisite qualifications will also be
eligible.’ One of the qualifications laid down was that they
should be ‘good riders’ before joining Lumsden’s Horse. Here
the value of previous training in military duties and of something
more than haphazard horsemanship was recognised; and
happily Colonel Lumsden knew exactly the sort of men who
would meet both requirements, especially as the limits of age
(between twenty and forty) brought the best of those who had
the riding and shooting experiences incidental to a planter’s life
into the category. It is not surprising if he showed a partiality
for them when rival claims had to be decided upon. The fact
that many of them offered to bring their own horses weighed
nothing with him, though he knew that the companies would
have to be mounted somehow and that the Government had
explicitly declined to provide horses for that purpose. Either
by private contributions in kind or by public subscription toward
the necessary funds for purchasing, a horse for each trooper had
to be furnished; but this consideration did not weigh for a
moment against the chances of a man who could only give
himself to the Empire’s service, so long as he had in essential
points better qualifications than other candidates could boast.
The wife of a prominent and popular soldier—now a general—asked,
as a great favour, that her brother might be allowed to
serve as a trooper in the corps. To such a pleader Sir Patrick
could not say ‘no,’ so he arranged a little dinner at which the
fascinating lady was to sit beside Colonel Lumsden. Whether
her gentle persuasions prevailed or the brother’s merits were too
obvious to be disregarded, it is certain that he joined the ranks
of Lumsden’s Horse, and so completely justified the choice that
he is now an officer of the Regular army and a Companion of the
Distinguished Service Order. Naturally, the selection of two
hundred and fifty men to represent all India from among a
thousand who were anxious for the opportunity of seeing active
service gave rise to much jealousy and heart-burning on the part
of the rejected. Reading some of their vituperations, one might
imagine that they had been aspirants to posts of high distinction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>or at least to lucrative sinecures, rather than candidates for the
khaki jackets of privates in a regiment about to share the hardships
of a perilous campaign. One disappointed applicant, whose
martial ardour was not to be quenched by rejection, wrote
angrily to the ‘Englishman,’ suggesting that there was gross
favouritism in the preference shown for planters over townsmen.
His letter is worth quoting at length as typical of the fighting
spirit that had been aroused everywhere by Colonel Lumsden’s
patriotic manifesto. Thus he wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>To the Editor of the ‘Englishman.’</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I hope I am in time to draw the attention of the Government to
the <em>Bahadur</em><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> style in which the selection to the ‘Indian Yeomanry Corps’
of Volunteers is being conducted. Because a man is the son of his father,
and owns a few ponies and a few hundred rupees, is he to be given the
preference as a fighting unit?</p>

<p class='c000'>There are to-day in India, even in the city of Calcutta, men of
unquestionable merit, men who are sons and the recipients of a heritage
of blood shed in England’s and her Most Gracious Majesty’s cause from
fathers who had bled and died for England and England’s prestige, and
I beg to ask you, Sir, are these men to be shelved to suit the convenience
of a few planters? I am not a planter, and, as an outsider, I put my
claims forward as a test of merit. I am willing to shoot a match up the
range with the best man selected from Behar, run him a given distance,
ride him on strange nags (catch weights), and in the end with my weight
and other recommendations beat him.</p>

</div>

<div id='i015'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_b_015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Bourne &amp; Shepherd</em></span><br />BEHAR CONTINGENT OF LUMSDEN’S HORSE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is quite a ring of mediaeval chivalry about that challenge
to ‘shoot up the range.’ One cannot mistake its blood-thirsty
significance, and perhaps it is lucky for the Champion of
Behar that he did not take up the gauntlet thus ruthlessly
thrown down. It will be noticed that this duel, after the manner
suggested by one of Bret Harte’s heroes, was to precede all other
events in the prolonged ordeal; and imagination shudders at the
picture of awful slaughter that would have been wrought, as the
picked marksmen of Behar and Hyderabad and Oudh and Assam
went down one by one, if they had dared to face the deadly rifle
of that truculent citizen of Calcutta, without getting a chance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>prove whether he could run or ride. Happily, the selected two
hundred and fifty kept their heads, so that the trial by single
combat never came off; but one must hope that a place was
found in Lumsden’s Horse for the self-confident challenger, and
that he proved as formidable on the field as in a printed column.
Readers may scan the names of troopers, whose occupations
before enlistment are all given in the Appendix, and yet be left
speculating whether or not the writer of that letter was among
the chosen after all. He will not be found in the first or
second section of Company A, composed almost to a man of
indigo-planters, or in the third section, whose tea-planters,
mainly from Assam, have not a townsman among them; and the
planters who make up an overwhelming majority of three
sections in Company B would equally disclaim all knowledge of
the fire-eating citizen. Can it be that he figures in the more
casual fourth section of either company, under the vague designation
of a ‘gentleman’ or a ‘journalist’? A little levity may
be pardoned now in reference to a matter which, at the time,
aroused some acrimony. All that, however, was swept away by
the wave of enthusiasm, leaving no bitterness behind it, even in
the minds of those who at first thought themselves humiliated
by rejection. If Lumsden’s Horse were almost entirely a corps
of planters, few questioned the care and discretion with which
Colonel Lumsden had chosen his men, and none could deny that
they made a goodly show at man&oelig;uvres on the Maidan, where
their camp was pitched within easy reach of the city. Though
quartered there for six weeks in circumstances that exposed
them to many temptations, those troopers behaved in a manner
that would have been considered exemplary for the best regiment
of disciplined Regulars. This is not surprising when we consider
that in civil life they had been accustomed to exercise,
command, and to exact obedience from others, even at the risk
of their own lives. At the outset Colonel Lumsden made it a
condition that he would have none but unmarried men in the
ranks, and to this rule there were few known exceptions, though
some Benedicts crept in undeclared. As a regiment, Lumsden’s
Horse had an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>esprit de corps</em></span> to maintain from the day of its birth
under auspices that made the occasion imperial, and every man
of it was tacitly pledged to prove himself a worthy recipient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of the honour conferred upon him as one of India’s chosen
representatives. How that feeling prevailed over all other
considerations in the moment when Lumsden’s Horse played
their manful part in battle for the first time, and how it held
them together in a comradeship that was akin to brotherhood
through after-months of hard campaigning, will appear as the
narrative unfolds itself. It began to have an influence while
the corps was as yet but an invertebrate skeleton, and it helps
to explain the anxiety of Indian Volunteers to join the ranks
of a force that was destined by the nature of things to become
historical. One can understand, therefore, the alternations of
hope and depression that passed over certain districts where
men who had offered their services waited anxiously for the
decision on which their chances of distinction hung. Some
glimpses of this may be got through the letters received by
Colonel Lumsden from all parts of India at that time, and from
the diaries in which thoughts as well as actions are recorded by
the men themselves. One begins his notes—two days after
Colonel Lumsden’s call for Volunteers had been published—with
the entry: ‘An express came from —— to say he had sent in
the names of twenty men from C Company.’ After waiting impatiently
several days for news that did not come, the diarist got
his friend to send two telegrams, one to Colonel Lumsden, the
other direct to the Adjutant-General at Calcutta, offering a complete
company. The next day somebody turned up with news
that they had been accepted. Jubilation on this score, however,
lasted no longer than twenty-four hours, when it gave place to
dejection caused by rumours that they ‘were not accepted after
all.’ This wave of depression passed away as speedily in its turn,
dispelled by the rays of hope that burst out radiantly on receipt
of a chit from —— ‘asking me to come in at once.’ Under the
next day’s date comes the crowning triumph of that anxious
time, told very simply but in a way that makes one feel the
nerves of those men throbbing through every word. ‘Started
for Chick,’ runs the entry; ‘met ——, who told me we really
were accepted. Then we met —— dashing along on his bike.
He had already upset a woman.’ A week later, after many
festive farewells, that contingent was on its way to Calcutta
and foregathering with other contingents, whose experiences had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>all been the same, for every man of them was buoyant at the
prospect of seeing active service, and would have regarded it as
a personal slight, if not an indelible stigma on his reputation
for courage, if he had been left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>So day by day the ranks of Lumsden’s Horse gained strength
until their numbers were complete and recruiting had to be
stopped; while many candidates whom the Colonel would
gladly have taken tried in vain for admission. It was a regiment
of which any commanding officer might be proud, whether
judged by physical or mental standards. A corps of planters it
might have been justly called, for they outnumbered all of
other occupations; but it represented many classes, and nearly
every district in India where sport-loving Britishers are to
be found. In its ranks were fifty-five indigo-planters, sixty-one
tea-planters, thirty-one coffee-planters, and five of similar occupation
not specifically designated. Beside these, the sixteen
Civil Service men of various grades, three bank assistants, twelve
railway officials, including civil engineers, three medical men
from the planting districts, one inspector of mounted police, a
brewer, a tutor, a journalist, and a few others whose peaceful
days until then had been devoted to commerce, form a comparatively
small proportion. Thus considerably more than half
the fighting strength were planters. Among the remainder,
townsmen must have been fairly represented, to say nothing of
artificers who formed the Maxim Gun detachment under command
of Captain Bernard Willoughby Holmes, whose services
had been placed at Colonel Lumsden’s disposal by consent of
the East India Railway Company. The Mercantile Marine
also furnished its quota in the persons of a captain, a chief officer,
a second officer, and two engineers of the British India Steam
Navigation Company’s fleet, and a chief officer of the Hajee
Cassim Line. A veterinary surgeon, police inspectors, policemen,
clerks in the Military Accounts Department, travelling agents,
hotel assistants, a photographer, a theatrical agent, and a superintendent
of the Rangoon Boating Club joined the Transport,
from which two very smart fellows were drawn into the ranks as
troopers during the campaign, and one of them was subsequently
gazetted to the West India Regiment as second lieutenant.
Counting all these, the enrolled strength was just 300.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Then came the difficult and delicate task of appointing
company officers and section commanders—a difficulty enhanced
by the fact that many Volunteer officers had enlisted as troopers.
I have said that the Government had given its unqualified
approval to Colonel Lumsden’s project. This statement, however,
applies only to the general scheme. It must be remembered
that he had made no stipulation as to his own rank, or
the right of selecting officers, and it was not in the nature of
a British War Office to let the prerogative of veto slip entirely
out of its hands. Colonel Lumsden’s own appointment as
commanding officer came directly from headquarters, on the
suggestion probably of Lord Curzon. Two other conditions, not
very irksome, the military authorities made at Colonel Lumsden’s
urgent request. These were that captains commanding companies
should be Regular officers on active service, and that the
adjutant, who would also act as quartermaster, should be
appointed from the Staff Corps or have graduated in it. These
nominations were left to the Commander-in-Chief in India, and
in the ordinary course of things they involved the appointment
of Regular non-commissioned officers as quartermaster-sergeants
and company sergeant-majors. Other subordinate posts for
which military experience or special training is necessary were
also filled by Regulars, who thus relieved the Volunteer troopers
of some laborious duties. An officer second in command, four
captains acting as senior subalterns, four lieutenants, a medical
officer, and a veterinary surgeon had still to be selected, and the
choice must have involved many anxious moments, seeing how
much depended on the unknown qualities that are hidden in all
men and may lie dormant for years, only to be developed for
good or ill in the crisis of an emergency. How Colonel Lumsden
succeeded in this, as in every other preliminary task that he
imposed upon himself, is now a matter of history to be dealt
with in proper sequence. The wisdom of his selections could
only be proved by events, and to these, as narrated by men
who were best able to judge, appeal may be confidently made.
Naturally, some who had held commissioned rank previously,
and thought their claims to consideration indisputable, felt sore
at being passed over in favour of others who were junior to them
in the Volunteer service. But this irritation was not allowed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>show itself or interfere with loyal subordination in all military
duties.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the inviolable pages of his diary one, whose merits were
not at the time so well known as they ought to have been, confides
the pregnant sentence: ‘Heard to-day that —— was to be
a <em>captain</em>, I a <em>corporal</em>.’ There the entry ends, leaving a blank
more eloquent than any scathing comment could have been.
For all that, the captain and the corporal remained on the best of
terms, and, though they ceased for discipline’s sake to call each
other by their Christian names, there is reason to believe that
both soon came to the conclusion that no very serious mistake
had been made in estimating their relative fitness for command.
At any rate, after a little friction they shaped themselves like
round pegs to round holes. But that is the habit of Britishers,
who, however unaccustomed to discipline, are not slow in
recognising its inevitable necessity and its inestimable value.
They come to see that without it no concerted movement,
whether big or small, is certain of success. You cannot conduct
military operations to a definite end, any more than you can
navigate a ship or rule a family, if individuality is allowed to take
the form of insubordination. These lessons Colonel Lumsden
began to inculcate in his peculiarly persuasive way directly he
had got his men together and placed officers in authority over
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men and officers, however, are not the only things necessary
to keep a fighting unit going when once it has been formed and
organised. Sir Patrick Playfair found the full equipment of
such a force no less costly than he had estimated. Fortunately,
however, he had foreseen all difficulties in this connection and
provided for them. After consultation with General Maitland,
General Wace (Director-General of Ordnance), Sir Alfred Gaselee
(then Quartermaster-General), Sir E.R. Elles (Adjutant-General),
and the late Surgeon-General Harvey, it was decided that nearly
a thousand rupees per man would be necessary for equipping the
force, buying horses in addition to those brought in by troopers
themselves, and establishing a reserve fund sufficient for all emergencies
that might arise while the men remained on active service.
This meant that a sum amounting to two and a half lakhs of
rupees, or about sixteen thousand five hundred pounds sterling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>would have to be got together by public subscription. Until this
campaign proved the depth and sincerity of Imperial sentiments
among nearly all classes of the community, few people, even
in England, believed that such a sum would be given to send
a mere handful of Volunteers on active service far from their
home. And most people, having but a superficial knowledge of
Indian affairs, would have ridiculed the suggestion that native
princes or merchants would contribute in proportion little less
than Johannesburg millionaires to uphold British supremacy in
South Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Patrick Playfair, however, knowing by experience how
liberal had been the response of those people to all calls on
their generosity, and gauging with remarkable insight the
genuineness of their loyal devotion in a time of possible peril to
the Empire, had no doubt what the result would be. But even
he was not prepared for anything like the unanimity of enthusiasm
that his appeal evoked. It took simply the form of a
general invitation to subscribe. The marvellous rapidity with
which the subscription list filled may therefore be taken as
a voluntary expression by Europeans and natives alike of
staunch fidelity to the cause for which Lumsden’s Horse were
being enrolled as a fighting unit. The contributors included
His Excellency the Viceroy (Lord Curzon of Kedleston), His
Excellency the Governor of Bombay (Lord Sandhurst), His
Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India (the late Sir
William Lockhart), their Honours the Lieutenant-Governor of
Bengal (Sir John Woodburn), the Lieutenant-Governor of the
Punjab (Sir W. Mackworth Young), the Lieutenant-Governor
of the North-West Provinces and Oudh (the Bight Honourable
Sir A.P. MacDonnell, P.C.), and the Lieutenant-Governor of
Burma (Sir F.W.R. Fryer). Princes, rajahs, landowners,
mercantile firms, and European residents almost without
exception, came forward, subscribing munificently, until the sum
of 227,000 rupees had been promised and received in cash, besides
contributions from tradesmen in kind amounting to another
100,000 rupees.</p>

<p class='c000'>No single subscription rivalled Colonel Lumsden’s splendid
offer, or came anywhere near it in amount; but Sir Seymour
King, K.C.I.E., M.P., on account of Messrs. Henry S. King &amp; Co.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>London, and two allied firms in Bombay and Calcutta, gave a
lump sum of 10,000 rupees, while Maharajah Sir Jotendro
Mohun Tagore, K.C.S.I., Rajah Sir Sourindro Mohun Tagore,
Knt., C.I.E., Nawab Sir Sidi Ahmed Khan, K.C.S.I., Mr. F.
Verner, Messrs. Apcar &amp; Co., and Kumar Rada Prosad Roy sent
5,000 rupees each. The last named, a zemindar, or landed proprietor,
was quite diffident and doubtful whether he ought to
subscribe without being asked directly, but he expressed a hope
that his contribution would be accepted. A great many merchants
and others who were only known to Sir Patrick Playfair
by name sent cheques for amounts varying from fifty to 2,500
rupees. No fewer than twenty-eight mercantile firms in Calcutta
subscribed 1,000 rupees each, and among the most liberal donors
were native princes of nearly every State in the three Presidencies.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Highness the Maharajah of Bhownagar, whose palace
is 2,500 miles distant from Calcutta, sent fifty Arab chargers
and saddlery; the Maharani Regent of Mysore, twenty-two
country-bred and Arab horses; and other potentates,
like the Maharajah Bahadur of Soubarsa and the Rajah of
Mearsa, gave handsome presents of a similar kind according
to the resources of their studs. The natives of Aligarh, clubbing
together, sent twenty-seven horses and one mule; while
one, Mohammed Mazamullah Khan, gave two horses, a mule,
a donkey, and two small sleeping tents, accompanied by a
touchingly simple letter saying, ‘They are all I have to help to
conquer the enemies of the Great White Queen.’ Other
contributions in kind ranged from tents sufficient for the whole
force presented by the Elgin cotton mills of Cawnpore, rough
serge cloth for all coats requisite from the Egerton woollen mills
at Cawnpore, puttees from Kashmir and Cawnpore, gaiters,
Cardigan jackets, hats, horseshoes and nails, forage, tea, coffee,
beer, whisky, and cigars, down to matches, of which no fewer
than 7,000 boxes were sent by one thoughtful gentleman. The
India General Steam Navigation Company, the River Steam
Navigation Company, the East India Railway, and the Eastern
Bengal State Railway combined to carry men and horses free of
charge from all parts of India to Calcutta.</p>

<p class='c000'>A small executive committee was formed by Colonel Lumsden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to carry out the arrangements for the equipment and despatch
of the corps. Its members were:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Colonel <span class='sc'>Lumsden</span>, <em>President</em>.</div>

      <div class='line'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Harry Stuart</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The work of organising naturally fell to Colonel Lumsden,
who was also busily engaged in selecting officers and enrolling
men; while Sir Patrick Playfair undertook the entire management
of the collection of subscriptions in cash and in kind, assisted by
Mr. Shirley Tremearne, Editor of ‘Capital,’ whose local knowledge
enabled him to render valuable aid in appealing to the mercantile
community where personal appeals were necessary, and in collecting
the promised subscriptions for which personal application
had to be made in accordance with traditional etiquette. Mr.
Harry Stuart, formerly executive manager of the Bengal State
Railway, took charge of all arrangements for receiving and
messing the different detachments on their arrival in Calcutta
from distant districts until a camp could be formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the mobilisation scheme—drawn up by the Indian
Headquarters Staff and sent to Colonel Lumsden after approval
by the War Office in London—promised no more substantial
assistance than the provision of arms, ammunition, rations, and
transport to South Africa, it furnished many suggestions of the
greatest importance, and, as a model for use on any similar
occasion hereafter, it is reproduced at length in the Appendix.
This document will be found of interest also as giving a comprehensive
idea of the many requirements for which provision had
to be made by Colonel Lumsden and his colleagues. Their
labours were lightened by the cordial co-operation of military
officials, who went out of their way to render every possible
assistance. Without the advice and practical aid thus given by
heads of departments of the Government of India, it would have
been impossible for Colonel Lumsden, or any other commanding
officer in his position, to have carried out all the War Office conditions
economically. Major-General Wace, C.B., as head of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the Ordnance Department, gave every facility for Colonel
Lumsden to indent on Government stores for clothing and
accoutrements at regulation prices, and not only so, but he and
Colonel Buckland, the Superintendent of Army Clothing, with
Major-General T.F. Hobday, Commissary-General, and Surgeon-General
Robert Harvey, C.B., were ready to place the fruits of
their long experience and special knowledge of various details at
the service of Colonel Lumsden whenever he felt the need of
advice in such matters; and Captain A.L. Phillips, an officer
on the Staff of Sir Alfred Gaselee, Q.M.G., was untiring in his
efforts to make the movement a success so far as his personal
efforts and influence could avail. So everything went well from
the beginning, thanks in great measure to the lively interest
taken in the corps by Lord Curzon, who was pleased to become
its Honorary Colonel, and by all officers of his personal Staff.
Her Excellency Lady Curzon was equally zealous and lent her
influence to every good work by which the ladies of Calcutta
sought to express their admiration, and perhaps their tender
regard, for the heroes who were going forth to fight. What form
that expression should take was a subject much debated and
long in doubt. Of course Sir Patrick Playfair had to be consulted
by a deputation of charming damsels. He thought a
bazaar might give them the opportunity they wanted. Yes!
that was just the thing; but then—and then came a string of
fatal objections. A smoking-concert was next suggested, and
the young ladies thought that idea splendid, only—well, in
short, it wouldn’t do. Then, as if it were the last resource to be
thought of—a sort of forlorn hope—Sir Patrick hinted that a dance
might meet the case. To that his fair interviewers demurred
most effusively; but then and without any hypnotic suggestion,
so Sir Patrick avers, they began to see that something might be
urged in favour of it, and at last, with a unanimity that was wonderful,
they decided that a dance was the only means of fitly celebrating
the occasion. Having come to that conclusion, all their
coy objections vanished in a moment. Sir Patrick saw his
opportunity and seized it to persuade them that, as it was to be
a ladies’ enterprise, they must manage it entirely themselves.
Thereupon they formed a committee, of which Miss Pugh was
elected Honorary Secretary, invited Lady Curzon of Kedleston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to become patroness, and set to work with an energy which no
mere man could hope to rival. They had of course to enlist
masculine services for subordinate duties. This they did with a
sweet despotism that made revolt impossible. The men had to
accept without a murmur the positions assigned to them as
stewards, and obeyed every mandate like the willing slaves we
all should be in similar circumstances. The committee of
ladies showed a business-like promptitude in settling every detail
and a faculty for organisation which won from a military admirer
the approving comment that they could conduct a campaign if
they would only give their minds to it. This or some other
feminine attribute had such an effect on the wine merchants of
Calcutta that they sent champagne for the ball-supper and
gallantly refused to accept payment. So the Calcutta Ball in
honour of Lumsden’s Horse became an assured success almost
from the moment of its happy inception. Brilliant beyond the
dreams of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>débutante</em></span>, it left on many a susceptible heart impressions
which neither time nor the changing scenes of warfare
could dim, as the secret archives, to which an editor alone has
access, attest; and in a less romantic way it proved the unselfish
devotion of those ladies, who, after paying all expenses, handed
over a balance of 6,000 rupees to the war-chest of Lumsden’s
Horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such financial aids came not amiss at the moment.
Government transports chartered by the Royal Indian Marine
for taking troops to Natal were delayed on the return, and,
one vessel having broken down, Colonel Lumsden found that he
would have to encamp his men on the Maidan for two or three
weeks longer than he had anticipated, and this entailed an
additional expenditure of nearly 1,000<em>l.</em> for extra rations and
comforts. To soldiers of Spartan mould, who pride themselves
on discarding luxuries at the first call to arms, this might have
seemed like pampering the Volunteer troopers; but it must be
remembered that in India men cannot give up the habits of a
lifetime all at once and come down to bare soldier’s rations without
danger to their health. And Colonel Lumsden’s first object
after getting his men was to keep them fit. His care in this
respect was justified by events no less than his judgment in
the selection of men for mental and physical attributes. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>end of a year’s campaigning he was able to boast that his
losses from sickness were proportionately less than in any other
regiment. This delay had its advantages in so far as it gave
Colonel Lumsden and his officers a chance of training the
troopers for their duties and accustoming them to their horses
before the day of embarkation. The postponement, we may be
sure, was no disappointment to the people of Calcutta, who felt
that the Maidan would be a cheerless blank without Lumsden’s
Horse. It will be well to give here a few details of organisation.
By War Office order the corps was to consist of two companies,
each commanded by a Regular officer, and the Government also
appointed a Regular adjutant to assist Colonel Lumsden in
executive work; while Colonel Eden C. Showers, Commandant
of the Surma Valley Light Horse, offered to serve as Major, and
was gazetted with that rank as second in command. When
other officers had been selected, chiefly on the recommendation
of commandants under whom they had served in Volunteer
Corps, they were posted in the following order:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Staff.</span>—Lieutenant-Colonel Dugald McTavish Lumsden,
Commandant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Eden C. Showers, Second in Command.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Neville C. Taylor, 14th Bengal Lancers, Adjutant
and Quartermaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Samuel Arthur Powell, Medical Officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Veterinary Captain William Stevenson, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary
Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>A Company.</span>—Captain James Hugh Brownlow Beresford, 3rd
Sikhs (commanding), Captain John Brownley Rutherfoord, Lieutenants
Charles Edward Crane and George Augustus Neville.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>B Company.</span>—Captain Louis Hemington Noblett, Royal
Irish Rifles (commanding), Captain Henry Chamney, Captain
Frank Clifford, Lieutenants Charles Lyon Sidey and Herbert
Owain Pugh.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Maxim Gun Detachment.</span>—Captain Bernard Willoughby
Holmes (commanding).</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Each company had a Regular non-commissioned officer as
Company Sergeant-Major and another Regular as Company
Quartermaster-Sergeant for office duties under the Regimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Quartermaster-Sergeant. Regulars from the Artillery, Cavalry,
and Infantry were also attached as Farrier-Sergeants, Saddlers,
and Signallers, and from the Indian Commissariat as Transport
Sergeant. The Maxim Gun Contingent, under Captain Holmes
was raised and equipped by the East India Railway Company,
who offered its services to Colonel Lumsden. The Calcutta
Committee had decided, with the sanction of the Government,
that Lumsden’s Horse should not want for adequate regimental
transport in the field, but, on the contrary, should leave India as
a thoroughly organised unit in that respect, with a complete
train of transport carts, ponies, and pack mules, all properly
equipped. It is hardly necessary to say that the grant of transport,
saddlery, and draught harness, for which provision was
made in the mobilisation order, did not comprise all that the
committee desired; but the inexhaustible Ordnance Stores were
again open to be requisitioned ‘on payment,’ and carts of the
Indian Army Transport pattern were drawn in a similar way
from the Commissariat Department. The ponies and mules, however,
had to be collected by agents in the hill districts of Assam
and Thibet, a distance of 1,000 miles from Calcutta. When
all this was done, the corps could justly be considered fit for
active service, and it is certain that no contingent, Volunteer
or Regular, landed in South Africa with a more efficient
transport than Lumsden’s Horse. It came near being upset,
however, by a War Office decision. Almost at the last minute
Colonel Lumsden was told that the native drivers would not be
permitted to accompany the corps, and that no natives could go
except one personal servant for each officer and a limited number
of syces, or grooms, in the proportion of one to each charger, as
laid down in the mobilisation scheme. This allowance of three
native attendants to every officer was on a sufficiently liberal
scale, but it did not meet the requirements for transport purposes.
Therefore Colonel Lumsden had to enlist European drivers, of
whom twenty-six were needed for each company. In ordinary
circumstances Anglo-Indian prejudices would have combined to
make this an insuperable difficulty; but so keen was the anxiety
of men to see war service in South Africa that they volunteered
to go in any capacity not necessarily menial, and so Colonel
Lumsden got the full complement of drivers together just as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>readily as lie had filled the ranks with fighting men. War Office
conditions stipulated that officers and troopers of the corps must
provide their own horses and saddlery, though nearly all of the
latter might be drawn from Ordnance Stores at cost price.
Naturally the supply of suitable animals for Mounted Infantry
work had to be made a corps affair from the outset. Very few
of the enlisted troopers owned horses of a class that they would
have cared to ride through the rough work of a campaign, even
if they could be always sure of having their own; and Colonel
Lumsden was not likely to countenance any claims of private
ownership when once horses were numbered as of the troop. He
therefore informed every man who brought a horse with him
that it must be considered corps property, and might not be
appropriated by its owner without the commanding officer’s
sanction. No other arrangement could have worked satisfactorily.
In consideration of this understanding Colonel Lumsden
promised that he would endeavour to obtain from Government
a scale of compensation for horses thus appropriated, and in the
event of being successful the sums obtained under this head
would be returned <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro rata</em></span> to the owners of horses. It may be
mentioned in passing that Colonel Lumsden’s efforts to this end
were ultimately successful, the Government consenting to allow
an average of 30<em>l.</em> per horse to the corps, so that every man who
brought his own charger was compensated at last.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The men having drawn their Lee-Metford rifles with short
bayonets and an abundant supply of ·303 ball cartridges, both
for practice and the sterner work to come, were duly clothed
and equipped, much to their satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not many of these things, in addition to rifles and ammunition,
were free gifts from Government, whose contributions in
kind had to be supplemented by purchases out of store at the cost
of corps funds and by gifts from the appreciative public to whom
no appeals were made in vain. The troopers, at any rate, were
troubled not a whit about these things, being quite satisfied with
the completeness of their personal outfit, even before Mrs. Pugh
and the ladies of Calcutta bethought them to work woollen
comforters for presentation to every man of Lumsden’s Horse
on the day of embarkation. They did not, however, take so
kindly at first to the Lee-Metford rifle. It was a new weapon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to most of the men, who had never handled anything more complicated
than the old Martini carbine. So batches of men went
to the ranges every morning to practise and accustom themselves
to the peculiarities of a firearm that made no more noise than
the crack of a whip and ‘had no kick in it.’ This was a time
of gradual but sometimes painful initiation to the hardships
and discomforts inseparable from camp life. Lessons, however
distasteful, had to be learned, and it must be said that
Lumsden’s Horse took the rough with the smooth cheerily
enough, enlivening their daily routine with many pleasantries.
They were always ready to laugh at a comrade or with him in
a merry jest at their own expense. Some literary contributions
from the ranks to local papers were amusing in their fanciful
exaggerations, which nobody enjoyed more than did the troopers
whose foibles were thus humorously railed at. For sanitary
reasons they were one day ordered, by medical authority, to
strike their camp and pitch it on fresh ground, whereupon one of

<p class='c000'>Like a bolt from the blue has fallen upon this camp the Æsculapian
decree that we must go hence! It happened to-day that the medical eye
of Lumsden’s Horse opened wide, and beheld strange sights. What the
vision was has not been recorded owing to no ink being found in camp
capable of expressing its blackness, but it is no secret that microbes as
big as mastodons were observed freely gambolling in the immediate
vicinity of the commissariat tent. The marvel is that a number of men
can have lived on such a spot for ten days without coming to more
serious harm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The green sward on the banks of the Tolly’s Nullah has presented an
animated appearance within the last few days, for every train arriving in
Calcutta has brought its quota to swell the corps. A number of men
from the Assam Valley Light Horse are now in camp. The Mysore
contingent is also established, while the Behar lads are expected
to-morrow by 10 o’clock. These will number a few over fifty, and will
prove no doubt the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>crème de la crème</em></span> of the corps. In a day or two the
Maxim gun will come into quarters, and Oakley, of Kooch Behar and Tirah
fame, has gone to some up-country sequestered spot whence comes a
particularly quiet <em>jat</em> of pony, where he will choose animals of gentle
temperament and so small that falling off them won’t hurt—for Maxim
gun men scorn to ride.</p>

<p class='c000'>This question of riding is no small one, and many gallant sportsmen
may be seen tearing down the lines trying to get there before their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>horses. One like this was advised by a real Tommy Atkins to sit further
back and so enjoy a longer ride. Not the least pleasurable sight in the
camp is when bold Volunteers begin grooming their own horses. Some
never do more than the neck, because of the risk attached to venturing
within range of hind feet, with which country-bred horses are notoriously
handy—if it may be so said of feet. Then saddling troubles others,
because of the difficulty in distinguishing between cantle and pommel
when a saddle hasn’t a horse inside to illustrate the difference.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>There is a touch of boyish imagination about that sketch,
but it is not altogether fanciful. Some of the Volunteers who
joined first were by no means experienced horse-masters, and, to
nearly all, the equipments for Mounted Infantry in full campaigning
kit were not less strange than military technicalities.
There was a rich fund of amusement for Lumsden’s Horse in the
unauthorised version of ordinary commands as one trooper construed
them. When sections in line were crowding too much
upon him he would say, ‘Fall off, man! Fall off to the left.’
The comrade thus admonished would murmur, ‘Hang it all,
man, that is just what I am trying not to do.’ Still, young
Malaprop would repeat, in defiance of the Sergeant-Major’s
peremptory request for silence in the ranks, ‘Fall off! fall off!’
meaning all the time ‘Ease off.’ These simple incidents of every
day gave a piquancy to camp ‘gup,’ and were the cause of more
mirth than the elaborate jokes concocted by literary troopers
could arouse. One civilian, in a playfully prophetic mood, devised
a new coat of arms for Lumsden’s Horse, which was published
in the ‘Indian Daily News’ as a clever play upon the cant of
Heraldry; though the Earl Marshal and all the Kings-at-Arms
and all the learned pursuivants of Heralds’ College might have
been puzzled if called upon to emblazon the quaint conceit with
its complicated quarterings, its proper shield of pretence, and its
lurid crest of augmentation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Life in camp on the Maidan was becoming somewhat monotonous
to men whose ardent spirits panted for opportunities of distinction
in the Empire’s service, and for freer movement on the vast
South African veldt. For traces of this yearning one may search
in vain through pages of diaries, to which men do not commit all
their secret thoughts. Perhaps they regarded a parade of warlike
sentiments as bad form even in the written impressions that
were intended only for private perusal. So they contented
themselves with noting briefly the minor events of listless days
and the mild excitements of evenings that passed swiftly enough
in such social pleasures as dining, theatre-going, or listening to
the latest London melodies at a smoking-concert organised in
aid of the war fund. Even a flower-show was regarded by some
as an amusement. We come across frequent references to baths
at the Swimming Club, tiffin at Pelité’s, and luxurious little
dinners at the Bristol, the Continental, or the Grand; but only
by inference, from the sudden importance given to these everyday
incidents of civilian life, can we gather what a contrast they
were to the coarser fare and rougher surroundings of meals in
camp. There is not a hint of discontent at being reduced for
the first time in their lives to soldiers’ rations or at the hard
fatigue work they were put to as a necessary part of the daily
routine. These manly young troopers were beginning to learn
the soldier’s lessons of subjection to discipline and endurance of
discomforts that must have seemed sufficiently like hardships to
most of them, but they had not acquired the habit of grumbling
which is Tommy’s cherished privilege. The visits of crowds to
that camp on the Maidan every Sunday were evidence enough
of the great interest taken by all classes of citizens in Lumsden’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Horse, who were properly appreciative of those attentions, and
not quite insensible to the sweet flattery of admiring glances
from pretty eyes. The motto that ‘None but the brave deserve
the fair’ is one in which gallant soldiers from all time have
found encouragement, and Lumsden’s Horse were beginning to
appropriate it with other soldierly attributes, for were they not
all brave and resolved to prove it? Their only fear was that
the chance of doing knightly deeds might not come to them,
and that they would land in South Africa only in time to learn
that the war had been finished before the tardy transports could
get there. Nevertheless, we know that they relaxed no efforts
to make themselves fit for the fray. From contributions by
troopers to the Indian papers we may learn how zealous they
were to master the least attractive duties of military life, and
Staff officers bear witness to the sincerity and success of these
endeavours. Mere forms of discipline might have been lacking,
and one cannot wonder that men who had lived similar lives,
sharing the same sports and social pleasures, found it difficult at
first to fall into their relative positions, some as officers, others
as troopers, and to keep each his own proper groove, ignoring old
associations. But the right spirit of subordination was there,
and a commander of Irregulars does not ask for more if he has the
true capacity for leadership. The daily routine of duties in
camp on the Maidan was designed to foster this spirit without
making the yoke of essential discipline too galling. A description
of it as given by one in the ranks will show that Lumsden’s
Horse were by no means pampered Sybarites even at that
early stage of their soldiering:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At 6 the ‘rouse’ sounds, and, some minutes later, men clad in khaki
breeches, putti gaiters, and flannel shirts issue from the little bell tents
into the clammy mist of early morning, and after obtaining a cup of tea
at the mess, remove the jhools—which are a most necessary protection
against the heavy dew—from their horses, and give them a rub down.
At 7 we hear the bugle call ‘Saddle up,’ and at 7.30 the men are all fallen
in on the Maidan in column of sections, and go through the various
evolutions, special attention being given to mounting and dismounting on
saddles packed with full kit, and the leading of horses, the correct and
rapid performance of which is so important in Mounted Infantry work.
The regiment is divided into two companies, each company consisting of
120 men formed into four sections, and these again divided into permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>sub-sections of four men each. As a rule the sections work independently,
each under its own commander. Blank ammunition is liberally
expended in order to accustom the horses to the rattle of musketry.
Most of the men are mounted on country-breds; but several ride shapely
walers averaging 14.2. Considering that 50 per cent. of the horses are
quite untrained as chargers, they are astonishingly quiet and well-behaved;
the C.B.s—with the exception of an occasional kicker, which plays
havoc in the ranks, and is a source of some danger to his unfortunate
companions, both men and horses—are quick, handy little brutes, and
already they have learnt to lead steadily and well. There are, of course,
a good number of trained horses in the ranks; the Mysore men, for
instance, being almost without exception mounted on Silidar horses,
which are proving most satisfactory chargers and are expected to do well
in Africa. After parade the horses are watered, fed, and groomed by
their respective owners, and then, as Mr. Pepys would have said, ‘to
breakfast,’ under a large <em>shamiana</em> placed at one end of the camp in the
shade of sycamore-fig trees. The morning passes quickly while men are
drawing and marking kit, cleaning rifles, or doing fatigue duty at pitching
tents and other healthy exercises. At noon we water and feed the horses,
and 1 o’clock is the tiffin hour. At 4.30 there is an afternoon parade,
sometimes by companies, and sometimes the whole regiment parading
under the Colonel or Major, after which water, feed and bed-down, and
then dinner, and an early retirement to bed. But not for all is this
happy rest. There are two guard tents, at opposite ends of the camp,
each company providing a sergeant and three men for guard every
twenty-four hours, while a man from each company is on sentry throughout
the night, his duty being to see that the horses are properly secured—head
and heel—and be on hand in case of sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not all tyros in war. Burma ribbons on the breasts
of some Surma Valley Volunteers who were at Manipur told of
previous service in the field, though against enemies very different
from the ‘slim,’ evasive Boer. Others who wore no badges of distinction
were believed to have fought in more than one campaign;
at least, the fair visitors declared that such a martial mien as some
men bore could only have been acquired on active service: it
bespoke a consciousness of great deeds gallantly done. The heroes
of these flattering tributes lived up to their reputations by
putting on an air of mystery, which the Colonel alone could have
dispelled, for none but he knew the history of every man in
the regiment. Still, nobody would have thought of looking for
suspected Boers or Boer spies in the ranks of Lumsden’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Horse. A good story, however, is told in this connection at the
expense of an officer who overheard two men in the uniform of
Lumsden’s Horse talking, in a tongue that was not English, at
one of the hotel bars. The officer, not recognising either of them,
listened curiously, and caught a few phrases which he declared
to be German by the sound (and he claimed familiarity with that,
though he did not know enough of the language to repeat the
words he had heard). ‘It was German, and no mistake,’ he said,
‘and those two men in our uniform were talking it fluently.
What could they be but Boer spies?’ One had a distinctly
Boer face, he thought, and, deciding that something ought to be
done at once, he assumed his most nonchalant air and asked the
two men politely for their names. In reply they gave names so
common in England that he could only regard them as aliases.
His suspicions being thus seemingly confirmed, he took into his confidence
two brother-officers, who, when the two ‘spies’ were pointed
out to them, saw the possibility of playing off a joke on the amateur
detective, for they recognised in the one with a ‘distinctly Boer
face’ a young planter from Behar whose fresh, boyish appearance
had won for him the nickname of ‘Baby.’ He looked innocent
enough to be capable of anything. Admitting that both these
men had come with them from up country, the two mischievous
friends added, ‘But we don’t know much about them.’ That
was enough for the investigator, who rose at dawn next morning
to prepare a circumstantial report for submission to the Colonel.
He declared this to be ‘his duty,’ and announced a stern determination
to go through with it in spite of pretended protestations
from many comrades who had somehow got wind of the story.
Their pleadings and wily persuasions only served to goad him on.
The responsibility of silence, which they sought to impose upon
him, was too much for one in his position to bear, so he hurried
off towards the Colonel’s tent, eager to make his startling disclosures.
On the way, however, he met a trooper, who unwittingly
‘gave the whole show away’; and the crestfallen officer learned that
the men whom he was going to denounce as Boer spies had been
coffee-planting for several years in Coorg, and that the language
they talked when exchanging confidences in a public place was
not German but Canarese. Such incidents as these helped to
while away the tedium of life in camp when the iron hand of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>discipline was beginning to make itself felt lightly but firmly. A
very little humour provokes much mirth when other entertainments
are scarce. By that time even the sing-songs in camp were
being cut short, and the only note of revolt that Lumsden’s
Horse were ever known to have sounded arose on that account.
It did not grow loud enough to reach the commanding officer’s
ears, but is recorded in the diary of a trooper who, after describing
a very pleasant little camp-fire concert, says: ‘We were all
packed off to bed at 9.30 by the Sergeant-Major, to our indignation.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Public efforts for their amusement, however, did not flag, nor
were camp regulations always enforced so strictly. These facts
we may gather from an entry that would have delighted the
methodical Samuel Pepys. ‘After dinner drove to the Grand.
Played snookers and won. Afterwards to the Biograph, to which
we were invited for nothing. Rather a noise cheering for the
Queen, Colonel Lumsden, &amp;c. Marched back singing, though
someone tried to stop us. The Colonel came too and bade us
sing. Had supper and more songs, and three cheers for the
Colonel, and to bed at two.’ These frank revelations are worth
whole columns of detailed description as giving an insight into
the character of the men who formed Lumsden’s Horse and their
adaptability to circumstances that marked the later days of their
camp life on the Maidan. The time for such festivities was drawing
rapidly to a close, and none but Puritanical moralists would blame
them for making the most of it after the manner of light-hearted
youth. They had serious thoughts on occasion, however, and
all their letters show how deeply impressed they were by one
ceremony. The date of embarkation was still uncertain when
on Wednesday, February 14, some two hundred officers and
men under Colonel Lumsden’s command, headed by the band of
the Royal Irish Rifles, marched from their camp to the Cathedral
in Calcutta, where a special evening service of farewell was to
be celebrated. The Viceroy and Lady Curzon, Sir John Woodburn,
Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, nearly every officer of the
Viceregal and District Staffs, with regimental commandants and
representatives of other Presidencies, attended, and a sympathetic
congregation filled every part of the building. Soldiers and
civilians joined in singing the Processional hymn, ‘Onward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Christian soldiers,’ their voices mingling with an effect never to
be forgotten by anybody who took part in that devotional service.
The Lieutenant-Governor read the First Lesson and Colonel
Lumsden the Second. The choir sang ‘Fight the good fight,’
and a deep silence fell on the congregation when Bishop
Welldon began his address to the contingent that numbered in
its ranks many men whose course in life had been guided by the
high principles instilled by him when he was master and they
schoolboys at Tonbridge and Harrow. In a clear strong voice,
the ring of which they knew so well, he spoke to them and their
comrades, saying:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>This is a service of unique interest in the history of our city, and of our
cathedral. It is one of those occasions which make us realise, amid many
differences, the essential fact of our national spiritual unity. All who
are loyal, all who are patriotic in Calcutta, are gathered or would have
gladly gathered within this cathedral to-night. There is not in all this
congregation—there is not, I think, in all Calcutta—a British heart that
is not moved with sympathy and admiration for you, my brethren, who
are going forth to the war in South Africa. And surely there is not a
British heart but feels how just it is, how wise and how truly consonant
with the best traditions of our race, that it should be your wish on the
eve of your departure to seek the protection of, invite the benediction of,
and to consecrate yourselves to the name and service of the Most High
God. For if it has been possible at other times and in other places within
the last few weeks to strike a note of felicity and festivity—I do not say
that they have been unduly prominent, but who has not heard them?—if
there has been excitement, merriment, and applause on your behalf, it is
a note that I would not sound this evening. You are going, I know, with
deep solemnity and resolution, and you are going as men who have undertaken
a noble duty from which you might have held aloof without reproach,
in the full consciousness of its cost and peril, and in the sure conviction that
the part you are playing is not unworthy, as indeed it is not, of the British
race and the British Empire. You are proud, then, of your self-chosen
mission, but it may well be that someone who looks forward with eager
anticipation to the future is yet, in his heart, possessed with the not
ignoble anxiety that warfare is no child’s play. It is stern and awful.
He who enters upon it with a light heart is no true soldier of God or man.
You are assembled now within the sanctuary of religion. In a few hours
or days you will set sail for a distant land. It is certain that you all will
be exposed to the strain and danger of the battlefield, and it is by no
means certain that all will return to their homes in safety. Some who
hear me now will probably yield their lives for the Empire. Can I forget
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>how, on the 24th day of last September, I shook hands at the Kidderpore
Docks with the gallant officer commanding the Gloucestershire Regiment,
and how within a few weeks from that day he had fallen—shot dead at
the head of his regiment? As his fate was, so may be yours. That is the
nobility and dignity of your service. The people of Calcutta would not
throng into this cathedral to pray for you, with you, if it were not impressed
upon their minds that you are inspired with the brave ambition
that makes great Empires great. When they shall bid you farewell, as
the troopship slowly passes into the distance, it will be with full hearts,
and believing that you will be true even to death, that they will one and
all say, ‘God bless you.’ You go for the conservation of the Empire.
I look upon the British Empire as the highest of human institutions, and
realise that the Empire appeals to the spirit of chivalry, magnanimity,
unselfishness, and devotion in all its members. Nobly, indeed, has India,
European and Native, responded of late to that inspiring appeal. Who is
there that has not felt his pride of Empire to be quickened by the generous
loyalty not of Englishmen only but of the princes and nobles of India to
her Majesty the Queen-Empress? For that loyalty, unexampled as it
is in the history of other peoples, is itself a witness to the beneficence
of British rule. May I venture, if only in passing, to express the hope
that such an exhibition of loyalty may bring comfort to the sick-bed of
that illustrious soldier, the Commander-in-Chief, who in a retrospect of
his life can recall many a battle in which Europeans and Indians have
fought side by side for the Empire? But if to the princes and nobles—may
I not add to the people of India?—the thought of the Empire makes
a paramount appeal, how much more to every man and woman of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Imperial spirit is in the air, it has passed from the chamber of
philosophical thinkers to the common life of the nation. We are all
Imperialists now, and it may be said in the sacred language, of our country
in relation to her colonies and dependencies, that ‘her children have
risen up and called her blessed.’ So in the hour of her stress and
suffering there is not one colony that has failed to render her aid with the
resources of its wealth, strength, and its armed men. Well is it, then,
that Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen resident in India should take
their stand with the colonists, not of South Africa only, but of Australia
and Canada, in a cause which makes them one, for the Empire means
not conquest alone. It means the principles upon which the modern
Christian world is broadly based—justice, equality, freedom of thought
and speech, intellectual progress, pure religion, and the sense of personal
responsibility to God. You go forth, and by your going you assert that
all the constituent members of the Empire are one. As the Apostle said of
old, ‘We are members one of another’; and again, ‘If one member suffer
all the members suffer with it.’ It is not nothing to you, and it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>matter which vitally and personally touches your interest, that to your
fellow-subjects in South Africa should have been denied the elementary
rights of citizenship and the common privileges of humanity. The injury
that has been done to them is done to you. That you should go forth in
a right and reverent spirit is the prayer of all who worship with you in
this cathedral. Is it possible—I hardly like to suggest the reflection—but
is it possible that we have lately thought too little of Almighty God?
Is it possible that we have entered upon the war with something like
levity in, the reliance upon our army and upon our pecuniary military
resources rather than upon Him who has made and sanctified our Empire?
Is it possible that we have forgotten that even if the ‘horse is prepared
against the day of battle’ yet victory is of the Lord? If so, let us return
to Him in penitence and prayer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us, confess our many failings and shortcomings, our imperfect
sense of responsibility to Providence, and our disloyalty, if such there has
been, to His commands. May you go forth, brethren, as trusting in Him,
for you believe that your cause is just. If it were not just, if it were the
cause of oppression or aggrandisement, may He Himself forbid that it
should prosper; but if it be His will to use you in His service, to make you
the instrument of His providence in the subjugation and pacification of
the country which has flouted the majesty of the British Empire, if He
has called you, and you have responded to His call, then His blessing will
abide with you always. It is in this spirit that we bid you an honourable
farewell. It may be that when you are severed by thousands of miles
of ocean from the country of your birth or of your adoption, the memory of
this service shall not wholly fade from your hearts. Here, in India, where
the majesty of the Empire was most fiercely assailed and most successfully
vindicated—here in this cathedral, where many monuments eloquently
remind you of the courage, faith, and heroism of your race down to the
memorial of those young Englishmen who laid their lives down for
their country saying that they were not the last English—here, in the
presence of the Power which controls the destinies of nations, we invoke
the Divine blessing upon your arms. One last word, one inspiring motto,
we will offer you. It is the watchword of our race: it is ‘Duty.’ ‘I thank
God,’ said Nelson to Captain Blackwood, on the morning of Trafalgar,
‘for this great opportunity of doing my duty.’ ‘Whatever happens,
Uxbridge,’ said the Duke of Wellington on the morning of Waterloo, ‘you
and I will do our duty.’ That the thought of ‘duty,’ inspired and sanctified
by Heaven, may dwell in your hearts is our prayer for you all—the highest
prayer that man may offer for man. May the God of our fathers be with
you always, and help you to be brave, generous, and merciful, and vouchsafe
to you safety; and if it be His will may victory and peace restore you
to those who love you so well at home or in India, and grant you in life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>or in death to prove yourselves worthy citizens of the Empire, faithful
servants and fellow soldiers of Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

<p class='c000'>and this was followed by two special prayers. Then came the
National Anthem, in the singing of which the whole congregation
joined, and then the Recessional hymn, ‘For all the saints who
from their labours rest.’ The service over, Lumsden’s Horse
marched back to camp through roads that were thronged with
enthusiastic spectators.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next ten days were crowded with necessary preparations
that left the men little leisure for enjoyment of social entertainments
arranged in their honour, yet they found time for a pleasant
gathering as spectators at an amateur performance in the Calcutta
Theatre, and possibly for some tender leave-takings of which no
note was made. They were not, at any rate, allowed to go away
without many manifestations of good-will from all classes and
abundant proofs of appreciation and care for their welfare by the
Government of India. It has already been said that his Excellency
Lord Curzon accepted readily the rank of Honorary Colonel
of the corps, while both he and Lady Curzon took every possible
opportunity of identifying themselves with a force in which they
continued to show the liveliest personal interest throughout its
career of active service. Sir William Lockhart, then Commander-in-Chief,
was lying in Fort William, Calcutta, dangerously ill of
the malady from which he died not long afterwards, and was
therefore unable to see the corps, but he sent to Colonel Lumsden
and the executive committee several messages of kindly encouragement.
The contingent was inspected on its parade-ground by
General Leach, C.B., commanding the troops in the Presidency
District. Sir John Woodburn, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal
and Honorary Colonel of the Behar Light Horse, also paid an
official visit to Colonel Lumsden and made a farewell speech to
the corps on parade the Sunday before its first company embarked.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Orders for the front had come at last, but one of the transports
had not. So it was necessary for Lumsden’s Horse to go
off in detachments. The ‘Lindula’ was alongside the wharves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in Kidderpore Docks, but she had no room to spare for more than
a hundred and fifty troopers, with their officers and the necessary
number of horses. Colonel Lumsden and the headquarters were
to go in her with A Company and the Maxim Gun detachment,
leaving B Company still camped on the Maidan, where Major
Showers would take over the command. Delays and alterations
of dates with regard to troopships, for which nobody in India was
responsible, would have been still more serious but for the
resourceful energy of Captain Goodridge, R.N., Director-General
of Marine to the Government of India, and Captain Gwynne,
R.N., the executive transport officer at Calcutta, who did all in
their power to expedite matters and to meet the wishes of
Colonel Lumsden, whose one anxiety was for the comfort and
well-being of his men on the voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before daybreak on Monday, January 26, 1900, bugles were
sounding the reveillé for A Company, and from that moment its
camp was a scene of liveliest activity. Though the men whose
turn to embark might not come for a week or two longer went
about their ordinary duties with assumed unconcern, they cast
many wistful glances at the busy preparations of their envied
comrades. Life in Calcutta had been pleasant enough to make
parting ‘such sweet sorrow’ for many that they would fain have
prolonged it at the last, but none gave a thought to such things
in the dawn of the day so long desired. For them all, South
Africa was then the goal of hope, and naturally the troops to go
first were deemed most fortunate. An old campaigner might
have told them of the days to come, when, in the weariness
of a realisation more hollow than their dreams, they would be
haunted by the music of that last waltz in Calcutta, and longing
to hear once more the rustle of palm fronds under soft Indian
skies, to breathe the sweet fragrance of oleanders and roses.
These thoughts, however, were unspoken, and if anybody had
ventured to hint at them he would have been rightly scouted as
a sickly sentimentalist by Lumsden’s Horse, who were going
forth to do the work of men. Yes; but somehow they were not
all adamant when they heard the cheers of thousands greeting
them as they marched through streets crowded with Europeans
and natives. The service company, in full campaigning kit,
took the lead, proudly conscious that all this was meant as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>an enthusiastic farewell to them and for the gallant Colonel
at their head; and B Company followed, wearing simple drill
order, with becoming modesty. An escort of ladies and gentlemen
on horseback accompanied the marching contingent. So
uncontrollable did the excitement of spectators become that they
broke in upon and mingled with the ranks, a confused mass from
which it was difficult for Lumsden’s Horse to disentangle themselves
and pass in any semblance of military formation through
the dock gates, within which they dismounted. Embarkation
of their horses would in ordinary circumstances have occupied
a whole day if the slow system of hoisting by slings had been
adhered to. Major Taylor, however, suggested the use of zig-zag
gangways, ascending by easy inclines stage above stage.
To this arrangement the broad wharves of Kidderpore Docks
were admirably adapted. Captain Gwynne, with a seaman’s ready
appreciation of common-sense proposals, consented to this departure
from former methods. The gangways were rigged accordingly,
and so the horses walked quietly up the slopes to their berths on
different decks instead of being slung on board in the barbarous
old fashion. The whole operation thus took an hour instead of
a day, and not a single horse was injured or had its temper
upset. While horses were being got on board the companies
drew up to await the Viceroy’s coming, where burning sunlight
fell full on the white helmets that were not to be worn again for
many a day. All their march from the Maidan had been like
a triumphal procession, to the accompaniment of cheers and
waving handkerchiefs; but a scene even more inspiring awaited
them at the docks, where a great crowd had assembled, making
the grimy wharves bright with the colours of dainty costumes.
People lined the parapets of surrounding houses in masses
uncomfortably dense, and a multitude thronged the jetty, alongside
which the transport ‘Lindula’ lay waiting to receive her
full complement of troops. Enclosures reserved for favoured
spectators were filled to overflowing, and at least 2,000 of the
number assembled there had to stand, the 3,000 chairs being
mostly occupied by ladies.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Judges of the High Courts and senior officials of all departments
were present. Lumsden’s Horse lined one side of a great
quadrangle facing the flower-fringed daïs from which Lord Curzon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>was to deliver his farewell speech. Behind them, stretching
from end to end of the line, were gay streamers bearing the
time-honoured mottoes that served to inspire Roman legions
when they set out in galleys to conquer the world. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Dulce et
decorum est pro patria mori’</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Fortes fortuna juvat’</span> are
sentiments that have happily not lost their meaning or their
power to influence the actions of men even in our unromantic
age. The crowds had gathered there to bid ‘God speed’ to the
first contingent of Volunteers that had ever left India to fight
for their Queen and country. And each unit of that assemblage
seemed eager to do or say something that might emphasise the
heartiness of the farewell. So general and earnest was this
desire that the police had great difficulty to keep the pressing
spectators within bounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>On arrival at the dock gates, their Excellencies the Viceroy
and Lady Curzon were met by his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor
and officers in attendance, who conducted them to the
Viceregal platform, above which the royal standard was hoisted.
Lord Curzon then inspected the ranks of Lumsden’s Horse, chatting
with their Colonel the while. This inspection over, his
Excellency returned to the daïs, and, in a voice that carried far
among the silently attentive spectators, addressed the corps in
these words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and men of
Lumsden’s Light Horse: In bidding you good-bye this afternoon, I feel
that I may claim to speak for others besides myself. I do not appear
here merely as the Honorary Colonel of your corps, proud as I am to fill
that position. Nor am I merely the spokesman of the citizens of Calcutta,
European and Native, among whom you have spent the past few weeks,
and who desire to wish you all success in your patriotic enterprise.
I feel that I am more than that, and that I may consider myself the
mouthpiece of public opinion throughout India, which has watched the
formation of this corps with admiration, which has contributed to its equipment
and comfort with no illiberal hand, and which now sends you forth
with an almost parental interest in your fortunes. At a time when the
stress of a common anxiety has revealed to the British Empire its almost
unsuspected unity, and its illimitable resources in loyalty and men, it
would have been disappointing to all of us if India had lagged behind—India
which, even if it is only peopled by a small minority of our own
race, is yet the noblest field of British activity and energy and devotion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that the world can show. Already the British regiments that we have
sent from this country have helped to save Natal, and many a brave
native follower has borne his part in the struggle. But as soon as the
electric call for volunteer help to the mother land ran round, India
responded to the summons. She has given us from the small civil
population of British birth the 250 gallant men whom I am now
addressing, and she would have given us as many more as Government
would have been prepared to accept. I doubt not that had we been
willing to enrol 1,000 instead of 250, they would have been forthcoming;
and that had not one thousand but many thousand volunteers been called
for from the native races, who vie with us in fervent loyalty to the
same Sovereign, they would have sprung joyfully to arms, from the
Hindu or Mussulman chief of ancient lineage and great possessions to
the martial Sikh or the fighting Pathan.</p>

<p class='c000'>You, however, are the 250 who have been chosen, the first body of
Volunteers from India that have ever had the chance of fighting for the
Queen outside their shores; and you, Colonel Lumsden, to whose
patriotic initiative this corps owes its being, and from whom it most
befittingly takes its name, are the officer who is privileged to command this
pioneer body of Indian soldiers of the Empire. Officers and men, you
carry a great responsibility with you; for it will fall to you in the face of
great danger, perhaps even in the face of death, to sustain the honour of
the country that is now sending you forth and of the race from which you
are sprung. But you will have this consolation. You are engaged on a
glorious, and as I believe a righteous, mission, not to aggrandise an
Empire, not merely to repel an unscrupulous invasion of the Queen’s
territories, but to plant liberty and justice and equal rights upon the soil
of a South Africa henceforward to be united under the British and no
other flag. You go out at a dramatic moment in the contest, when,
owing to the skilful generalship of an old Indian soldier and Commander-in-Chief,
and to the indomitable gallantry of our men, the
tide of fortune, which has too long flowed against us, seems at last
to have turned in our favour. May it carry you on its forward crest to
Pretoria itself! All India applauds your bravery in going. We shall
watch your deeds on the battlefield and on the march. We wish you
God speed in your undertaking; and may Providence in His mercy
protect you through the perils and vicissitudes of your first contact with
the dread realities of war, and bring you safely back again to this country
and to your homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden and men, on behalf of your fellow-countrymen and
your fellow-subjects throughout India, I bid you farewell.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is ample evidence from the letters of troopers themselves
to prove that Lord Curzon’s eloquent words inspired them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>with an ideal which they determined at all hazards to live up to,
and perhaps it is not too much to say that the conspicuous
gallantry everywhere and at all times displayed by all ranks of
Lumsden’s Horse is directly traceable to the high conception of
their duty breathed in every sentence of the Viceroy’s speech,
though they paraphrased it in more homely language, taking for
their regimental motto ‘Play the game.’ For a while after Lord
Curzon had finished speaking the troops were silent. Then they
raised lusty cheers for his Excellency and Lady Curzon and
the people of Calcutta, who in their turn cheered Lumsden’s
Horse again and again. The Viceroy and his suite, accompanied
by Colonel Lumsden, Sir Patrick Playfair, and other members of
the executive committee, then went on board the ‘Lindula’ for
a final inspection of the arrangements made for the comfort of the
corps, whose horses had already been shipped. Meanwhile Mrs.
Pugh had presented each officer and trooper with a Prayer-book,
and in giving it she said a few simple words that touched all
hearts. Some tender scenes of leave-taking had been enacted,
and men came back to their places in the ranks with faces not
quite so hard as they thought. There may have been sobs in
the sweet voices that whispered ‘Good-bye!’ but if so they
were lost in the loud chorus that rang out from comrades
cheering each other. Then the band struck up ‘The Girl I Left
Behind Me,’ and the troopers of A Company marched on board
the ‘Lindula.’ As she cast off from her moorings amid many
touching demonstrations and more enthusiastic cheers, the
strains of music changed to ‘Auld Lang Syne.’ The sun had
set then, but crowds lingered, cheering still and waving handkerchiefs
until the transport disappeared in the gathering darkness.
She dropped down to her anchorage in Garden Reach that night,
and when Calcutta awoke next morning she had gone, bearing
the first contingent of Lumsden’s Horse towards South Africa.
Colonel Lumsden’s appreciation of all that had been done for
the corps was expressed in the following letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'><i>To the Editor of the ‘Englishman.’</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—On the eve of leaving India for South Africa with the corps
which I have the honour to command there is one pleasant duty which
I have to fulfil. This is to convey, in the most public manner, to all who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>have helped me in raising ‘Lumsden’s Horse,’ my grateful thanks for
their sympathy and support. To the Viceroy, who has accepted the
Honorary Colonelcy of the corps, I owe more than can be stated in this
letter, for his Excellency removed all difficulties which lay in the way of
sending an Indian Volunteer Contingent to the seat of war. To his
Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal and his Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief I am indebted for their support and sympathy.
Sir Edwin Collen, Military Member; Sir Edmund Elles, Adjutant-General;
Major-Generals Maitland and Wace; Surgeon-General Harvey; Brigadier-General
Leach; Colonel Money and Captain Drake-Brockman;
Colonels Buckland and Spenser, Army Clothing Department; Captain
Gwyn, Royal Indian Marine; Captain Philipps; Colonel Mansfield,
Commissariat Transport Department; the Commissariat Staff in the
Presidency District; one and all gave me the benefit of their experience
in military matters in addition to official assistance which was of the
highest value. There were many occasions when their personal influence
smoothed over difficulties connected with organisation and equipment,
and made my task much easier than it would otherwise have been. I wish
gratefully to acknowledge the special kindness of Major Pilgrim, I.M.S.,
who medically examined the members of the corps. To the executive
committee—Sir Patrick Playfair, Colonel Buckingham, Colonel Money,
Major Eddis, Major Dolby, and Mr. Harry Stuart—I am most deeply
indebted, for they have all worked hard from first to last; to the general
public who responded so handsomely to the appeal for subscriptions; to the
Press, who gave full publication to the movement; to the donors of camp
equipment, kit, and things in kind; to the railways for their assistance;
and to the India General and River Steam Navigation Companies, who
carried the Assam Volunteers free of cost; to these I must express the
warmest thanks, not merely on my own part, but on behalf of every officer
and man of the corps. They, indeed, rendered it possible for my scheme
as a whole to be carried out. To Mrs. Pugh and the ladies of Calcutta
we can only say that their labour of love will never be forgotten by
‘Lumsden’s Horse.’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Four days later welcome orders came for B Company to be
ready for embarkation, and, early in the morning of March 3,
Major Showers, in command of all that remained of Lumsden’s
Horse on the Maidan, marched out of camp, escorted by Europeans
and natives principally on horseback. For them the
enthusiasm that had marked the departure of their comrades
was revived with even greater fervour, and though this second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>leave-taking was less ceremonious than the first, it lacked
nothing of the heart-stirring eloquence that rings through the
voices of people when they are moved by great impulses. The
Viceroy, when he addressed Colonel Lumsden and A Company,
had spoken his farewell to the whole regiment. This second
demonstration, though accompanied by many signs of official
interest, was in all essential characteristics a popular movement
in which all classes joined with the more impressive warmth
because it was the last tribute they could pay to Lumsden’s
Horse before the corps might be called upon to take its place in
the fighting line. The Lieutenant-Governor (Sir John Woodburn)
and the Bishop of Calcutta made eloquent speeches that
were emphasised by repeated cheering; and with many cordial
words of farewell ringing in their ears, to the musical accompaniment
of ‘Auld Lang Syne,’ Major Showers and his hundred
troopers embarked on board the ‘Ujina.’ After she had steamed
down the Hugli there was no more work to be done by the
committee, whose members had laboured with patriotic self-sacrifice
to raise and equip Lumsden’s Horse and send the
contingent forth a perfectly organised force in all respects. The
executive committee then practically handed over all its authority
to Sir Patrick Playfair, who never ceased for a moment to
watch over the interests of the Contingent, for which he had
already done so much. The following letter shows how greatly
Lumsden’s Horse were indebted for their rapid and complete
organisation to the business capacity and indefatigable industry
of Sir Patrick Playfair:</p>

<div class='c020'><span class='small'>S.S. ‘Lindula,’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> for South Africa: March 12, 1900.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>My dear Playfair,—I have felt ever since leaving Calcutta that I never
half thanked you for what you did for Lumsden’s Horse, and no one
knows so well as myself, or appreciates more to the full, the work you
did on its behalf. Now, when I have time to think calmly over the
events of the past two months, I can see plainly that the successful issue
things were brought to, financially and otherwise, was entirely due to your
energy and guidance; and this without in the slightest degree depreciating
the valuable services of your fellow-workers on the committee, as I
feel confident one and all of them would coincide heartily with my
sentiments....</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours always,</div>
<div class='c019'><span class='sc'>D.M. Lumsden</span>.</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Life on board a troopship does not offer much material for
graphic description, and none but a Kipling could give to its
ordinary incidents an absorbing interest for general readers.
Nevertheless, it has charms for those who look at it with eyes
fresh to such scenes, and for Lumsden’s Horse, at any rate, there
was a novelty in the situation not wholly unpleasant in spite of
the many discomforts they had to endure and the distasteful
duties necessarily imposed upon them. They were learning
there a harder lesson than any of which their experiences in
camp on the Maidan could have given the slightest conception. It
is one thing to go a long voyage on board a liner as first-, second-,
or even third-class passenger, but quite another to be penned up
between decks in a crowded transport with native servants and
Lascars, eating coarse Government rations served in the roughest
fashion, doing the work of grooms and lackeys, and sleeping on
bare planks in an atmosphere odorous with exhalations from
stables and galleys. They had enlisted for a soldier’s life, however,
prepared to take the rough with the smooth, and, being in
for it, they made the best of their circumstances after the first
rude shock of feeling what military service really means had
worn off. Discipline may become a property of easiness anywhere
else, but on board ship the line that separates rank from
rank must be sharply drawn even in the case of a Volunteer company.
Comradeship and interchange of friendly greetings between
officers and men may still go on as of old; but they cannot make
a trooper forget for a moment that certain privileges follow rank,
and disabilities cling to those who have it not, while these facts
are thrust upon him insistently at every turn and dinned into
his ears by every bugle call to duty or to meals. It is well that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>we also should remember these things in estimating the sacrifices
that Volunteers make when they give up the comforts, if not
luxuries, of home life and go forth to fight for country and for
empire as private soldiers. The privations, the rough fare, the
hard marches in all weather, exposure to rapid alternations of
heat and cold, fierce sunshine where there is no shelter by day,
and pitiless rain from which there is no escape at night, hunger,
wounds, and sickness—all these may be cheerfully borne because
they are the lot of all ranks alike. Not so, however, with the
petty humiliations and drudgery inseparable from many duties on
board a transport, where the mere trooper finds that a soldier’s
uniform is a badge of distinction truly, but the distinction at
times brings with it something closely akin to a sense of humiliation.
The company or regimental officers may do all they can
to take the keen point off this goading sentiment, but it will
wound where there is the least protection against it and rankle too.
One must say to the credit of Lumsden’s Horse that they did not
allow such considerations to trouble. There is no trace of discontent
in their published contributions to Indian papers, of
which some extracts from the ‘Englishman’ may be made by
way of giving a picture of the voyage as troopers looked at it.
We left the ‘Lindula’ steaming down the Hugli apparently
well on her way towards South Africa. Though lost to the view
of interested crowds who looked for her soon after dawn on
the morning of February 27, she did not pursue an uninterrupted
course. At this point a trooper of A Company takes up the story
in a lively narrative, writing thus:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The absurd antics which the river Hugli thinks it necessary to go
through ere flowing to rest in the bosom of its old mammy Ocean compel
mariners to sail on it by day alone, and then to go as cannily as a cat on
hot bricks. On Tuesday morning we dashed off letters and telegrams,
and with a sigh of relief despatched them by the post boat, thinking we
were fairly off for Afric’s sandy shores. But no! We had not reckoned
with the lead line, which recorded much the same number of feet
and inches that the good ship ‘Lindula’ drew, so with a Heave! Ho!
Holly! the anchor fell overboard, and then we were stuck for a whole
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fancy getting up at 4.30 in the pitch dark! And no chance of shirking
either, for the decks are swabbed down and clean as a child’s plate after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>a penny dinner by 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> of the clock. Five-thirty heralds a cup of tea,
and 6 o’clock sets every nag aboard neighing and whinnying, for do they
not know it to be feeding time, better even than the Sergeant-Major,
who marches about with a little stick marking time? Then stables—a
pleasant job for the deaf and dumb, but trying to a man who wishes to
retain the lily-white unstained purity of his mind. Nine o’clock is the
signal for the bugler to tootle ‘Mary! come to the cook-house door,’ and
before he gets to the ‘y’ in Mary, A Company is tumbling head over
heels down the fore companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spinning down the river with the banks gradually receding from sight
raises everybody’s spirits, and a merry lot we are when from the Sandheads
comes a telegram announcing the capitulation of Cronjé—news greeted by
loud and continuous cheers. A little way more and the pilot brig heaves
in sight, and soon we lie to in her neighbourhood, listening to round after
round of hoarse cheering from the white-hatted figures aboard. Our pilot
drops over the side, accompanied by a great sheaf of our last messages to
friends, and we get up steam, waving good-bye to India, and begin our
voyage, never a man of us for whom the future does not loom big with
adventurous hopes; never a man of us reckoning of the toil or peril.
Young British blood, hot and eager, keen to flow more swiftly, keen to
taste of the life that has given the world so many great names, so many
great deeds. India, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>au revoir</em></span>!</p>

<p class='c000'>The gentle reader must not imagine that we have nothing to do.
Breakfast finished at 10 o’clock, the bugles wax busy, and call after call
resounds through the ship, summoning sections to various tasks. One of
the earliest parades of the voyage was that to practise the fire alarm and
‘boats.’ Every man has his appointed place, and lest any should hurry
unduly for the boats, sentries have been told off to guard these, having
their rifles loaded with ball cartridges, and orders to shoot the first man
who may attempt a rush. This extremely important matter has been
thoroughly impressed on our minds by practice, and should the alarm be
given in stern reality we all know where to make for.</p>

<p class='c000'>Needless to say, rifle exercise is one of the chief things to which we
must pay attention, and morning and afternoon the words of command
ring through the ship as squad after squad is put through its facings.
Fatigues are innumerable. Bringing forage and stores on deck is a daily
task; oiling and packing away saddlery; cleaning spare arms; painting
side arms; marking equipment and a dozen other things. Then a
signalling class is terribly busy, and a row of otherwise intelligent-looking
lads wave their arms wildly to the accompaniment of strange sounds
bellowed by the signalling instructor.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the rifle exercises have sunk into the minds of men, they are
allowed to practise shooting. Every day, at 12 and 2, parties assemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>on the quarter-deck and shoot at wine cases, biscuit boxes, bits of paper,
anything that affords a mark. In spite of the rolling and pitching
of the ship, and, what is worse, the vibration caused by the screw,
wonderful practice is made. A bit of paper a few inches square is hit
several times at 200 yards, and as the larger obstacles recede they are
repeatedly struck. Men firing have to judge their own distances, and the
practice on the whole has been marvellously good. The Maxim gun has
had a turn, too, and a very terrible weapon it is. In spite of the extreme
disadvantage under which it labours when placed on a moving platform,
excellent shooting has been made with it. An ordinary beer barrel at
800 and 1,000 yards was douched with spray, and then struck after three
or four shots had been fired. The noise is atrocious, but it is grand to see
the bullets striking the water, one! two! three! four! ever nearing the
mark, and then, five! Plump in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though we have lots of work to do we don’t forget to play, and many
are the tasks indulged in. One of the favourite amusements is boxing,
and morning and evening a ring is formed wherein all may enter for
a round or two. A few matches have been got up, and desperate battles
have been fought betwixt champions of the various sections. Naturally
party feeling runs high on these occasions, and everybody in the ship,
from the Colonel and the Captain down to Carpenter Chinaman John,
takes up a place outside the ring, watching the fray with bated breath.
The end is usually a black eye or blood drawn, neither of which temporary
inconveniences prevents furious and friendly handshakings at the finish.
Singlestick has supporters, but none so many as the gentle art of boxing.
Cockfighting has many votaries, and wrestling a few, for both of these
elegant diversions may be partaken of in the comparative dark. Duty
and pleasure are combined in tubbing. A sail bath four feet deep and
some six square is slung and filled with sea water. The bather, dressed
‘altogether,’ stands well back and runs at the bath, rolling in head over
heels. Number one is followed quickly by more, one on top of the other,
until the bath is nothing but a struggling mass of arms and legs. Then
the hose is turned on, and every man must take his turn or pay the
penalty of being thrust underneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>On our first Saturday night at sea the skipper—Captain Steuart—was
kind enough to permit a smoking-concert to be held on the quarter-deck,
where the saloon piano had been comfortably ensconced on a raised stage
ornamented with flags. Corporal Blair took the public fancy tremendously
with some of the comic songs that soldiers delight in. Corporal Skelton’s
recitation about the Volunteer Instructor who complains of his squad that
‘They Largifies,’ fairly brought the house down. Among others who
gave us pleasure were the brothers Wright and Private Woods, who, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à
trois</em></span>, drew much melody from the banjo. The following morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>(Sunday) we had service on deck, the Colonel and the Captain reading
the Lessons. The little book so thoughtfully presented to every man by
Mrs. Pugh was used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crossing the line was a most unexciting experience, for no Father
Neptune came on board, nor did any of the other time-honoured things
befall us. Alas! for the merchant navy! We did not see Ceylon
at all, but during the night we passed, in the distance, a light which
shone out from somewhere on its coast. That was our last sight of the
outside world until we had crossed the great Indian Ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, the horses have had a good time, very different from
that endured by shiploads coming over from Australia. Most of them
get a grooming of sorts every day, and many get an hour’s walking
exercise round a small circle once or twice in the week. It is
wonderful to behold an animal with legs puffed out like tea cosies
begin his little tour and finish up with extremities clean cut as those of
a racehorse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, there is a good deal of sickness among them in various forms of
fever and colic. First, Private Case, from Behar, lost a very clever little
horse. Since then two more have died, one a valuable mare, the
property of Lieutenant Crane, of Behar, and the other the charger of
Private Atkinson, from Mussoorie.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifth officer of the ship, a braw lad frae Glescae, finds it very
trying to hear us miscall the different parts—‘pairts,’ he says—of his
beloved she. ‘A ship’s no like a house, wi’ upstairs an’ doonstairs,’ he
plaintively remonstrates. And when any of us join him in a cigar and
throw the stump out of the ‘window’ instead of the ‘scuttle,’ the poor
man almost cries. One continually finds him gravely pointing out to
little knots of men the absurdity of referring to the back or the front of
a ship. He explains how it ought to be ‘forrard’ and ‘aft,’ and ‘above’
and ‘below.’ Then someone will mildly query where ‘astarn’ comes in,
and how it is possible to distinguish between port and starboard. And he
tells. But, all the same, we continue to search for each other upstairs
and down; we lie on the floor, forgetting it is deck, and it still passes
our comprehension how ‘loo’ard’ can be at one side of the ship one day
and the opposite to-morrow. This fifth officer is a bit of a humourist, too,
and, finding an appreciative audience, plays off a rich fund of nautical
yarns that have gathered raciness in the course of long centuries since
they were translated from the Portuguese of Vasco da Gama. The
narrator evidently thinks that Lumsden’s Horse are as credulous as ‘the
Marines.’ Perhaps he takes them to be a mounted variety of that species,
and, being a naturalist among other things, he has a scientific motive for
studying their peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden confirmed the following non-commissioned appointments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in A Company, some of which were provisionally made before
leaving Calcutta:</p>

<p class='c000'>Regimental Sergeant-Major: C.M. Marsham (Behar L.H.); Company
Sergeant-Major E.N. Mansfield (Punjaub L.H.); Sergeants: H. Fox
(Behar L.H.), E.M.S. McNamara (Behar L.H.), R.S. Stowell (Poona
V.R.), and W. Walker (Assam V.L.H.); Lance-Sergeants: F.L. Elliott
(Assam V.L.H.), D.S. Fraser (Oudh L.H.), J. Lee Stewart (Coorg and
Mysore R.), and R.E. Dale (E.I.R.V.C.); Corporals: Percy Jones
(Behar L.H.), G. Lawrie (Oudh L.H.), E. Llewhellin (Behar L.H.), and
H. Marsham (Behar L.H.); Lance-Corporals: A.M. Firth (Behar L.H.),
A.C. Walker (Assam Valley L.H.), E.J. Ballard (Punjaub L.H.),
H.F. Blair (Behar L.H.), D.J. Keating (Calcutta Port Defence), W.S.
Lemon (Calcutta V.R.), A. Macgillivray (Behar L.H.), and J.W.A.
Skelton (Assam V.L.H.).</p>

<p class='c000'>Transport Establishment: Lance-Corporals R.P. Estabrook, C.T.
Power, J. Charles, S.W. Cullen, and G.W. Palmer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It could not be expected that 150 men would be together on board ship
for three weeks without a certain proportion going sick. Lance-Sergeant
Lee Stewart, of the Coorg and Mysore Rifles, was struck down with
pneumonia. Shortly afterwards Private H.H.J. Hickley, of the Behar
Light Horse, was attacked by the same illness aggravated by pleurisy.
About this time a large number were bowled over. Blame was laid on
the tinned provisions, but, probably, if men had worn the mufflers, so
tenderly knitted for us by Calcutta ladies, about their waists instead of
round their necks much pain and trouble would have been avoided. The
decks at night were covered with sleeping figures, clad and unclad in every
degree. At turning in, a gentle zephyr that wouldn’t disturb the ringlets
on a fair lady’s neck might be blowing, and in an hour a sharp breeze
laden with heavy rain would sweep down and drench the unconscious
sleepers. Then one of the immediate results of an order for men to go
about barefooted was that Private Clayton-Daubney, of the Behar Light
Horse, took a fall when turning a slippery corner and broke his collar-bone.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Sir Patrick Playfair Colonel Lumsden wrote while at sea
a letter that is interesting as a proof of his interest in and care
for the men under his command. They paid many glowing
tributes to him afterwards, but none that gives a better key to the
hold he had on their respect than his own simple words as they
appear in the following extract:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>I regret to say Hickley, from Behar, is in a very bad way. He had
fever and pneumonia to start with, and has now gone clean ‘pāgāl,’<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>though quite quiet and harmless, has to have two men in close attendance
day and night. I had him taken into the saloon yesterday, in a cabin
near my own. I am intensely sorry for the poor chap, as, unless a
sudden recovery takes place, we shall have to make arrangement for the
authorities to look after him when we land. We have one more case on
board, which I was in hopes it might not be necessary to mention.
Stewart, the planter from Mysore, had an attack of pneumonia which has
taken a chronic form, and I fear there is small chance of immediate recovery.
He may have to go into hospital at Durban—whether we land
there or not—and I much doubt his ever being able to join us again.
You will remember my telling you about him, a man of independent
means (married, with a family), who came for the love of the game. He
was a most useful man, knowing a lot about horses, and was made an
acting sergeant almost as soon as he arrived, and put on to help
Veterinary-Captain Stevenson. He did excellent work on board until
he got ill, and I shall miss him much. It is his own wish to land if he is
not better.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond this we have had a most delightful voyage, simply perfect
weather, and a sea like glass. The men act up to our corps motto
‘<em>Play the game</em>’ like the good chaps they are. You should see them at
stable work in the morning, with nothing on but trousers rolled up to
their thighs, or pyjamas ditto, and later in the day, washing their kit or
making up puddings and cakes of sorts—some of the latter are works of
art! We have a lot of musical talent on board, and have had a couple of
excellent concerts. Captain Steuart added to the enjoyment of the last
by giving a magic-lantern show. He is a very good sort, and has done
everything in his power to ensure the comfort of the men. After finishing
our daily inspection to-day he confided to me that he had never seen a
troopship better kept, as regards order and cleanliness. The men are
being practised daily in the use of the rifle, dropping boxes and wisps of
straw overboard for targets, and I am more than pleased with the way
they are shooting, at a moving target from a moving ship. You might
also mention to my friend General Wace that Holmes is making excellent
practice with his Maxim gun.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is one picture of life in a troopship under the happiest
conditions. There is another side to the picture, of which we
may get glimpses in the experiences of men in Company B, to
whom Calcutta’s citizens gave a hearty ‘God speed’ when they
embarked in the ‘Ujina’ at Kidderpore Docks on March 3. Before
she had cast off from her moorings the troopers had been called
to dinner, and that feast was a revelation to them of all they were
leaving behind. One corporal described it as ‘a sort of stew in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stable-buckets, too filthy for anything’; but that may have been
merely a little ebullition of aristocratic prejudice. Nevertheless,
he and two comrades hurried on shore, and drove as fast as they
could to Madan’s in the town, where they invested 200 rupees in
sundry things which they regarded as necessaries for their
sustenance during the voyage. They were back in time to hear
the Lieutenant-Governor’s and Bishop Welldon’s speeches, and
then to join in a parting cheer for their old adjutant, Captain
Martin, who only left them to go on shore as the ‘Ujina’ cast off.
The subsequent proceedings of that day are not recorded in the
corporal’s diary, who contents himself with noting that he ‘had
some tea—no milk, and awfully sweet.’ When he awoke next
morning, after a restless night on bare planks between decks, the
thought of creature-comforts must have been uppermost still, for
he was aware of ‘gnawing pains—result of nothing to eat,’ and
his morning reflections begin with the disjointed phrases: ‘No
knives and forks. No salt. Those who had penknives were
lucky. Fortunately we all had fingers.’ Was there in those last
words a prophetic suggestion that some of them might not
even have fingers for such uses after a while? If so, the gloomy
foreboding passed without record, giving place to action, for at
6 o’clock that morning the corporal whose notes throw a
glimmer of light on much of the darker side that is too often
ignored, found himself in charge of a stable fatigue, wading at
the heels of the horses in a foul, dark, unventilated drain about
thirty inches wide, from which nothing ran off. He mentions incidentally
that the four unfortunate men who had to clear away
this accumulated filth were ‘very indignant’; and from this we
may gather that they used adjectives to express their opinion of
that first stable fatigue on board ship. It does not read like the
best possible means of promoting a healthy appetite, but when
called to breakfast three hours later they looked with dismay at
a loaf that was to last each of them the whole day, and when
one small tin of brawn was put before them for division among
sixteen men at a table, they came to the conclusion that it
‘seemed very short commons indeed.’ Some of the men found
that their carefully-arranged kits had been thrown aside in a confused
heap to make room for native followers, and they ventured
on a mild remonstrance, but were told, ‘You must look after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>your own things; you don’t have your bearers here.’ That
obvious truth had impressed itself upon them very forcibly some
hours earlier, while they were doing stable fatigue, and it needed
no rubbing in. Other trials followed, as we gather from a brief
but expressive note: ‘Dinner at 1.0. Soup and a messy stew in
buckets, as before. Tried to get some salt unsuccessfully, and,
returning, found the stew all gone. Beer was served out, which
I didn’t drink. Gave my bottle away and drank water, hot and
cloudy, out of a bath-tin. No knives or forks yet. Through our
mess-room, while we feed, files a long procession of syces, transport
wallahs, servants, Candaharis; sometimes a herd of goats,
and always Lascars, carrying ropes, hoses, or buckets. Now they
have kicked us out from where we were making ourselves
comfortable below, and I miss much a corner, even such as my
horse has, where I could put my things in safety. At night we
throw our straw mattresses wherever we can find a vacant space,
and scramble in confusion for our kits out of a heap of exactly
similar ones. We would gladly have paid our own expenses for a
little more comfort. The last straw came at 7.30, when the “cook-house”
bugle went again, but the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>chef</em></span> said, “No orders to cook
anything more,” and shut the door in the faces of orderlies. The
N.C.O.s then went in a body and complained. Result—bread and
beer were served out. It was bread and water for me. Lay my
mattress down among the horses, and was comfortable in spite of
the stuffy smell and stamping about all night.’ Still, his thoughts
seem to have dwelt on the idea that there was much to complain
of—the coarse tin pots, the tea extremely sweet and without
milk, the hot and dirty water—not even a dry canteen from which
to supplement the scanty fare, and so on until he dropped into
sweet sleep. That sleep must have been very refreshing, or a
considerable change had come upon the ship by the next
morning, when the food had improved greatly, and at supper the
‘men were merry enough, with great singing of songs.’ Later
entries in this diary show that the first highly-coloured outbursts
of discontent were due mainly, if not wholly, to a sudden change
from the luxury and plenty of a planter’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ménage</em></span> to the comparative
coarseness of a simple soldier’s fare—otherwise Government
rations—in necessarily rough circumstances. The additional
comforts thoughtfully provided by the Calcutta Committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>for consumption on the voyage were by mistake stowed away
with baggage and other stores below. Thenceforward matters
mended day by day, and, though there were still some discomforts
to be endured, they seem to have been relieved by more
amusements than appear in the letters sent for publication
to the Indian newspapers. On the whole, however, a fairly comprehensive
idea of the way in which B Company passed its days
on board the ‘Ujina’ may be formed from the following letter,
parts of which were published in the ‘Indian Daily News’:</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Hard work and plenty of it has been the order of the day ever since
we came on board. The greater part of this is in connection with the
horses. It is, of course, of very great importance that we should be in a
position to move forward as soon as possible after landing, and, bearing
this in mind, Major Showers and his officers are doing their utmost to
keep the animals fit. For the first day or two bran mashes were given
the horses, with as much hay as they could eat. This has been gradually
augmented, until they are now getting a mixture of bran and gram or
linseed three times a day. The watering and feeding are carried out with
the greatest regularity, each section officer personally superintending the
work. Our daily routine may prove interesting to the uninitiated in
these matters. Awakened by reveillé at 4.30, we have time to put our kits
in order before getting a cup of tea at 5.30. Half an hour later the bugle
sounds ‘stables,’ and the men immediately assemble on the lower deck,
each section separately, to answer the roll. Absentees who are not on
the sick-list, or engaged in fatigue or other duties, have their names noted
down, and are dealt with afterwards. Each horse is taken out of his stall
and thoroughly groomed, and the stall itself cleaned and disinfected daily.
The horses are then watered, a certain number of men being told off for
this duty; the rest are occupied in drawing and mixing the feeds, which
they place in tin troughs, one in front of each horse. As soon as word is
passed that watering is completed, the command ‘Feed’ is given, and the
troughs are immediately lifted and fixed on the breast-boards attached to
each stall. The hay is then served out in bundles, each horse getting six.
These are opened and put in the bags hung over the horses’ heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stable picket, consisting of three men from each section, is
posted at 7 o’clock in the evening, and is on duty for twenty-four
hours—till seven the following evening. Each man takes his turn as
stable sentry for eight hours altogether out of the twenty-four—two hours
on and four hours off. A non-commissioned officer is in charge of all
four section pickets, and he also is on duty for twenty-four hours until
relieved when the guard is changed next evening. He is expected to go
round the pickets two or three times during the night, and see that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>sentries are at their posts all right. The orderly officer also visits the
pickets twice during the night. The duties of each sentry are to see that
the horses do not get loose, or injure themselves, or ‘savage’ each other,
and that they are fed properly.</p>

<p class='c000'>After breakfast, at 8 o’clock, the men’s time is generally taken up in
cleaning rifles and accoutrements, and washing and dressing themselves
for a general parade at half-past 10.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men are then kept busy at the manual and firing exercise for
about an hour, and also bayonet exercise occasionally. The inspection of
the steamer by the Captain, accompanied by Major Showers and
officers, including the doctor and veterinary officer, also takes place at this
hour, and Major Showers afterwards inspects the company. For the next
hour or two we have little to do bar fatigues until the time comes for
watering and feeding horses at midday stables.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the afternoon the men usually employ themselves in playing
cricket, boxing, wrestling, football, and tugs-of-war, until the bugles sound
for evening stables at 5.30. Sunday is a day of rest, as far as possible,
only necessary work, such as ‘stables,’ being done, and church parade is
held at 10.30, the service lasting about half an hour. There are almost
daily calls for fatigue parties, a few men being taken from each section to
bring up stores or forage from the hold, and this is pretty hot and dirty
work. At 9 o’clock every night the ‘last post’ sounds, and half an hour
later ‘lights out.’ After that ‘there is naught but the sound of the lone
sentry’s tread’ or the squeal of an angry horse to disturb the peaceful
slumbers of snoring troopers on board the ‘Ujina,’ until the notes of
reveillé, shrill if not always clear, wake them at dawn to another day of
similar routine.</p>

  <h2 id='chap04' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <span class='small'><i>NEARING THE GOAL—DISEMBARKATION AT CAPE TOWN AND <br /> EAST LONDON</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Though something went wrong with the ‘Ujina’s’ engines, which
had to be stopped twice for repairs in the Bay of Bengal, she
covered the remaining fifteen hundred leagues or so in very good
time, and, passing Madagascar during the misty night of March 18,
was within sight of the South African coast by daybreak of the
24th, and at midday she anchored off Durban, being unable to
get nearer that port than the troubled roadstead two miles from
shore. Thus her time from the Hugli to Port Natal was just
three weeks, and those on board had the satisfaction of hearing
that the ‘Lindula,’ with A Company, must be still at sea, having
left Durban for Cape Town only three days before the ‘Ujina’s’
arrival. The man who brought that good news had evidently
acquired a Kaffir or Oriental habit of saying the things that are
pleasant whether true or not. In sober fact, the ‘Lindula’ had
gone a week earlier, and was by that time landing her troops at
Cape Town. As nobody was allowed to land, Lumsden’s Horse
did not get the exciting experience of being lowered in a cage
from the troopship’s gangway to a tug plunging and tossing and
wriggling among the ‘rollers’ twenty feet below. But they had
an opportunity of seeing how the thing was done when a Transport
officer came on board that way with an order for the troops
under Major Showers’s command to disembark at East London.
This officer was accompanied by three of the Natal Carbineers,
who had been with Sir Redvers Buller’s force to the relief of Ladysmith,
and whose thrilling tales of adventure were as welcome
as a newly-discovered series of Arabian Nights’ stories might have
been to men who had heard no news for twenty-one days. The
general situation was not quite as those Carbineers described it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>but their account of Boer resistance in Natal did not by any means
convey the idea that war was nearly at an end, although rumour
magnified Lord Roberts’s successes to the extent of placing him
within a march or so of Kroonstadt at a time when his troops
were still hung up at Bloemfontein waiting for food and transport.
As B Company had heard of Cronjé’s surrender and the
relief of Ladysmith before leaving Calcutta, it would hardly have
surprised them to learn that the Union Jack was floating over
Pretoria. To them the mere occupation of Bloemfontein seemed
a comparatively small matter, so they at once turned and began
to rend with keen sarcasm the croakers who had predicted that
B Company at least would be too late for anything. Too late!
Why, their orders were to disembark at East London, and did not
that mean an immediate start for the front? One sanguine
trooper in the gladness of his heart wrote, ‘We go on shore at
11.30 to-day, leaving for Bloemfontein by train about the same
hour to-night, and expect to arrive in forty-eight hours. We
shall probably train to Bethulie and march from there to Bloemfontein,
about 120 miles.’ His faith in the marching powers of
Lumsden’s Horse must have been great indeed if he thought
they could trek 120 miles across unknown veldt after travelling
from East London to Bethulie by rail, and all in the
space of forty-eight hours. There is something very fascinating
about that picture of troopers so eager to be at the taking of
Kroonstadt (‘which, it would seem, will be a big affair’) that
they would perform superhuman feats to be there in time. No
admirer of Lumsden’s Horse would venture to suggest that a
march of forty leagues in less than two days was beyond the
compass of their powers, but the man must be brimful of hope
who could believe that there would be any time left for marching,
or any inclination to march left in the men, after a South
African railway, working under war pressure, had done with them.
But in fact there was no such need for haste. B Company was
quite in time for the ‘big affair’ at Kroonstadt, though it took more
than twenty times forty-eight hours in the getting there. Colonel
Lumsden, going ahead with A Company to land in Cape Town, had
still more reason for entertaining sanguine views, though in his
case they were modified by a fuller knowledge of events. When
in sight of Table Mountain he added a postscript to his letter:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>‘Off Cape. Just got orders. May be in for Pretoria. Hope so.’
The two companies, however, were not fortunate enough to
come together under one command until nearly a month later.
Their fortunes as separated units must therefore be dealt with in
somewhat disjointed form still. How A Company fared after
casting anchor off Durban may be told in the words of a special
correspondent pf the ‘Englishman’ who had joined the corps
for active service:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>As we came in sight of Durban everybody was expecting that some
official would dash on board directly he knew it was Lumsden’s Horse,
to order us off down the coast, and that in a minute we should be steaming
hard for our destination. But it happened otherwise. When fairly
close in we signalled to the Coastguard station what ship we were and
what she contained. Then a deep silence settled over things. Lots of
shipping lay at anchor there, and every ship except ours had a steam
launch calling upon it. But we, waiting with beating hearts, had no one
to pay us a visit until a great puffing, rolling, important-looking tug bore
alongside, churned up the blue water into white foam, dropped a tiny
boat, and in a jiffy a blue-suited, gold-braided gentleman was on board and
the tug had gone away over the waters. So we thought that meant
orders to bring us ashore. But, alas! it was only a pilot come aboard
to have a buck with the captain. Then, while we waited and waited,
our signalling class set to work, and an energetic waving of arms and
little flags elicited the reply from neighbouring ships that Ladysmith had
been relieved. They also confirmed the news, which we had received at
the Sandheads, of Cronjé’s surrender. Close by lay H.M.S. ‘Terrible,’
from which a naval contingent had been sent with her big guns to
reinforce Sir Redvers Buller on the Tugela, and our first sight of one of
the consequences of war was a launch full of wounded Bluejackets returning
to their ship after relieving Ladysmith. While we lay peacefully
swinging at anchor a great white ship flying the Stars and Stripes and
Union Jack steamed slowly out of the harbour, and swung off to the left.
As she passed a big transport the troops on board broke into ringing cheers,
and when she neared us those with glasses read her name. It was the
‘Maine’ full of wounded soldiers from Sir George White’s gallant
garrison. She went right round the harbour, visiting all the ships with
troops. Last of all she came to us, and as she passed by, and we could
see the white-aproned nurses and the bandaged figures with pale faces
we gave them three times three, and still cheered again for the plucky
ladies who had come all the way from America to care for our wounded.
The poor chaps aboard did their best to answer our cheers, and then the
‘Maine’ steamed away down the coast on her way home to England.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>However, the long-delayed <em>hookum</em><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> came at last, and a great shout
broke forth when it was announced that we were ordered to proceed to
Cape Town. We sat down to dinner at 7.30, and as we toasted
Ould Oireland because ’twas St. Patrick’s Day, the ‘Lindula’s’ anchor
heaved, and the screw that for twenty days had toiled without ceasing
began its unremitting task again. When morning broke we had steamed
well down the coast, passing the lights of East London in the night.
Ten miles away was the seashore, bare, and uninteresting, but still the
Africa that we had come some six thousand miles to argue about with
the redoubtable Boers. And now we had to reckon with a foe that used
no weapons nor fought with hands. This was Mother Ocean, who must
have been troubled in her mind, for her breast heaved and tossed, and our
good ship rolled until—well, better change the subject. The coast slipped
by, and on the forenoon of the 20th we sighted afar off the flat top of Table
Mountain. Steaming across the wide mouth of Simon’s Bay we saw
hundreds of sharks—brown brutes that scooted away, showing a black fin,
as the steamer ploughed her way through the waves. Then rounding the
Point we sailed into Table Bay, and dropped anchor with a grand feeling
of satisfaction that the voyage had ended. Journeying by sea is
pleasant enough when you do it first class by P. and O., but when you
go no class at all, and sleep on the deck, and get turned out before 5,
and spend a big part of the day clearing out horse stalls or cooking
your own food, and enduring lots of other discomforts, it’s no catch at all;
and it was with intense relief we took our place among the lines of
troopships in Cape Town harbour. And what a sight it was! Ships! ships!
ships! And everywhere more ships! And most of them transports.
From great 10,000-ton White Star Atlantic liners down to little coasters
like our own ‘Lindula.’ All around us were vessels full of troops.
Every hour or two a new one came in, or one weighed her anchor and
steamed slowly by into the dock to disembark her living freight. Other
ships were crammed from stem to stern with cattle, sheep, horses, leaving
barely enough room on deck to turn the wheel. Vessels were packed
like herrings in the harbour: so thick did they lie in places you could
hardly see the water for ships. There we waited, and next morning the
Health Officer came on board and gave us <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>pratique</em></span>, which meant a clean
bill of health and freedom to land. Another day of waiting for the pilot.
Then after a great rush and scurry collecting kit we slowly slid into
harbour. And, lo and behold! it was Cape Town—Africa at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disembarking is not a pleasant pastime, especially when 150 men
have had three weeks in a ship during which to lose and mix up their
belongings. But the order to clear out and make room for another
ship was given, and had to be obeyed in a hurry. So we said good-bye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>to the ‘Lindula.’ Poor thing, she had done her best for us, though in her
we lost four of our chargers and two transport ponies, a big proportion of
our total of 180 animals, but nothing like the number that died on some
other ships. A transport lying near us with Imperial Yeomanry lost 39
out of 450 in a three weeks’ voyage—nearly all from pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our orders were to proceed to Maitland Camp, some four miles to the
north of Cape Town, and thither we marched, leading the horses, which of
course were hardly in a fit state to ride. However, the walk seemed to
do them good, and after a week in camp, with good feeding and gentle
exercise, they picked up condition rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men have little that is good to say of Maitland Camp. It is
a place stale, flat, unprofitable, and altogether accursed. When we
arrived the wind blew a hurricane, and setting up the tents was a task
to try a Stoic. Once they were up the sand crept in at every crevice and
lay thickly on everything, especially butter and food of every sort. Men
went to sleep, or tried to, with the feeling that the bit of the earth on
which they lay must surely be swept into the next world ere morning
broke. But day dawned and we were still in Maitland Camp, with the
rain pouring in torrents and turning the sand and earth into mud puddings,
which clogged and wetted and dirtied every scrap that belonged to us.
However, the third day recompensed us, for the sun shone hot and bright,
and a gentle breeze wafted delicious scents from the woods of eucalyptus
and fir trees all around. Boys came to us with delicious grapes, great
bunches weighing one to two pounds apiece, each grape being as large
as a pigeon’s egg and as full of juice and flavour as fruit can be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Cape Town we saw very little, but liked that little much; only
the price of things is terrible, and it seems much more serious parting
with shillings than with rupees. Lumsden’s Horse had many eyes for
the beautiful, and while declining to play the part of Paris in deciding on
rival charms, they wax eloquent when their theme is the sex which, as
one gallant trooper says, has done much to make this world the habitable
place it is. In Cape Town the ladies are charming to look at. They dress
just as they do at home in summer, and their cheeks are rosy, and they are
altogether delightful to look upon. But still it matters little whether the
cheeks be pale or rosy, we are all ready to back our ladies of India against
any in the wide world for kindness and every other feminine attribute.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having inspected our transport, the Army Service Corps officers at Cape
Town approved of our carts, and reported favourably on them to Lord
Roberts; but at the same time stated that they considered a team of two
ponies inadequate to draw the load we had designed through sandy
tracts, and suggested two leaders to each cart, an increase of 200 lb. in
the load, and a decrease in the number of carts. The Chief of the Staff
having approved of this suggestion, we handed over to the military authorities
twenty ponies (not our best) and ten carts, and harness complete,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>receiving in exchange seventy-six mules, with harness, and twelve Cape boys
to assist as drivers, so that when B Company arrives our united transport
establishment will consist of thirty-six carts and two water-carts, with two
mules as wheelers and two ponies as leaders to each cart, and there is little
doubt that we are as well provided with transport as any troops in the
field—indeed, much better than most. The Remount Department in Cape
Town were very good to us, and replaced not only our losses on the voyage,
but a number of horses which on landing appeared unfit for service,
giving us in all twenty-four chargers. The animals cast in Cape
Town were old and unlikely to get into condition for a long time, if
ever they did so. Our Calcutta purchases and horses brought by troopers
themselves are nearly all doing well. In place of those we had lost on
the voyage—six or seven altogether—Government gave us thirteen fine
Australian cobs, which were told off as remounts for the Ceylon Contingent.
But, the latter having been mounted in the meantime by the
military authorities and sent to the front, their horses were very properly
handed over to us. In Cape Town we found it necessary to make several
purchases to supplement equipment and replace losses. These consisted of
grass nets and picketing pegs for the horses, and <i>vel-schoen</i> and canvas water-bags
for the men; besides stores amounting in all to about 150<em>l.</em> worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, we have to leave four men in hospital. Sergeant Lee
Stewart, whose illness was mentioned in the last letter, is much better, but
greatly debilitated from the trying time he has had. He has hopes of
joining us later. Another bad case is that of K. Boileau, from Behar,
who was attacked with pneumonia and was very ill indeed at one time.
However, we have good reports of him, and hope to hear in a few days
that he is all right again. Shaw, of the Assam Contingent, and Doyle, of
the Transport, are also in hospital from trifling ailments, and they ought
soon to be able to join us. Many of the men are suffering from cuts and
sores on hands and feet, which do not seem to heal up as fast as they
ought. Hickley, who was pretty bad when the last letter went, is now
all right again, but Daubney has still to be careful of his broken collar-bone.
When we arrived at Cape Town we at once heard we were to proceed to
Bloemfontein, to join Lord Roberts, as speedily as possible. But the
movement of large bodies of troops with supplies caused a block on the
railway, and we were delayed eight days. The wait, however, did the
horses good, and they picked up hand over fist at Maitland Camp.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>All these details, when looked at in the long perspective
where more recent events show up sharply and perhaps a little
out of focus, may seem insignificant as objects seen through the
wrong end of a telescope. At the time of occurrence, however,
they had an importance that impressed itself on the minds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>men to whom nearly every incident of active service was then a
novelty. And the historian’s duty in such a case is rather to
reproduce impressions than to preserve an exact proportion.
Moreover, some incidents that may appear trivial by comparison
with great episodes, or with decisive actions on which the fate
of an army hung, were potent in shaping the fortunes of
Lumsden’s Horse as one small unit of a mighty whole, and in
this respect, if for no other reason, they are worthy to be
chronicled. It is the story of Voltaire’s miller and the King of
Prussia. What a division is to the general in chief of an army
corps a company is to the regimental commander, and, for
Lumsden’s Horse, the smallest adventures of their own comrades
had an interest which the civilian reader may perhaps begin to
share when he comes to know more of them.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At Cape Town Colonel Lumsden got the first news of B Company
since leaving Calcutta. They had been ordered to East London to disembark
there, and entrain at once for Bethulie, ‘right in the Orange Free
State,’ as Colonel Lumsden remarked, adding, ‘So they bade fair to get
there before us, despite our week’s start. But our latest news of them is
that they have stopped at Queen’s Town, and we know no more of them
except that they had a most successful voyage.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>A corporal of the Surma Valley Light Horse, however, supplies
the necessary information. He tells how he went with an ambulance
fatigue party, to which, among others, Dr. Woollright had
been told off as an orderly, in charge of Trooper Seymour Sladden,
who was very bad and had to be taken on shore at East London
before the company knew its probable destination. From a little
jetty that juts out from the wooded banks of the Buffalo River they
drove in an ambulance with the sick man up those steep winding
roads past the luxuriant Queen’s Park, with its odorous gum-tree
groves, to the hill top. There they carried Sladden ‘into a
nice clean hospital and left him in charge of kindly nurses, where
everything looked very comfortable.’ Then, somehow, they
managed to miss their officer and made inquiries for him in
vain at Deel’s Hotel, with the result that when the corporal and
his comrades reached the landing-stage they found to their
‘extreme joy the crew gone and no way of getting off to the
ship, so returned to the hotel and had dinner. Afterwards very
sleepy and went straight to bed, and slept like a hog. First time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>in bed for many weeks, and found it comfortable indeed.’ Other
non-commissioned officers and troopers of B Company carry on
the narrative in notes that diverge frequently and wander off to
alien topics, so that for the sake of coherence they must be
dovetailed together here in proper order, each chronicler in turn
taking up the story. When those troopers who had not begun
to realise the enormity of breaking leave returned to their ship
early in the morning of March 27, they met with quite an ovation,
which does not seem to have been disinterested, seeing that they
were supposed to have brought off with them fruit, cigarettes, and
other delicacies much in request. What they had would not have
gone far to satisfy the cravings of a whole company for some change
from bare rations. News that orders had come for Lumsden’s
Horse to disembark, however, put everybody in high spirits at
the prospect of being allowed to go on shore with freedom to
forage for himself. But they reckoned without their host—the
military commander—whose instructions brooked no delay. Kits
had to be packed in a hurry while the ‘Ujina’ was being towed on
a flowing tide across the troubled bar into port, where she moored
alongside the railway wharf. Horses were then got on shore, but
only to exchange cramped stalls for cattle-trucks, where they had
still less room for movement. At this task the troopers toiled
and sweated all through the fiercest heat of a summer noon,
learning another lesson and not liking it much. Unaccustomed
to such work, many got their toes trodden on by horses rushing
down the steep gangway or narrowly escaped more serious injury
before every fretful animal could be coaxed or lifted into the
crowded trucks. Then there were saddles, kits, heavy baggage,
and ammunition to be landed, and so without leisure for a single
meal the troopers worked on far into the night. It was nearly
11 o’clock before the last section took its place in the train.
‘Something attempted, something done, had earned a night’s
repose’; but there was little chance of getting that, packed together
as they were nine or ten in a carriage. Time must have
softened the impressions of these discomforts on the mind of one
trooper, who, some days later, wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We left East London on March 28 by rail <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> for Bethulie, where
it was intended we should quit the railway, mount our horses, and trek to
Bloemfontein.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>East London turned out in force to see us off. Little boys and girls
(some of the latter not so very little, after all) were very keen to get hold
of our shoulder badges as mementoes, and, needless to say, the susceptible
ones of our corps were unable to resist the entreaties of the fair
ones, and daylight showed a vacant place on many a shoulder-strap.
This badge-collecting seems to be a great hobby out here just now; one
boy showed me a belt simply covered with badges, which he had secured
from the men of the different regiments that had passed through. We
travelled in second- and third-class carriages, ten men in each, but it being
quite cool we were not uncomfortable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another correspondent, whose experiences were evidently not
so pleasant, takes a less roseate view. He says hard words about
the South African war method of standing men, some forty-five
or so in a cattle-truck, encumbered with heavy coats, rifles, and
other baggage—a leaky roof, and no sides.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>This may be economical, as the Major said, but on a wet blustry night,
when buckets of rain, mixed with soot from the engine, are falling, it is
not a style of travelling that conduces to comfort. Then there is still
another African style—namely, ten men with rifles, &amp;c., in a third-class carriage
meant to hold eight only. Both of these methods we sampled on our
way up to Bloemfontein. And right glad I was when we had done with it,
and took to the saddle. Some, however, confessed to having slept very well
that first night in such strange circumstances, tired out as they were by
hours of previous toil, though they woke next morning very cold, with
nothing to eat but one loaf, which ten men divided between them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>They had eyes for the picturesque as well as for the agricultural
possibilities of a country where Nature does much and
man apparently very little, except to stroll about watching the
cattle graze and the crops grow, unless he happens to be a
Kaffir, which makes all the difference. Chiefly, however,
Lumsden’s Horse must have been struck by the barren, rocky
kopjes that seemed to spring suddenly in the midst of fertility
and rise range behind range, stretching away to the mountains,
which looked so near that it was impossible for imagination to
measure the breadth of intervening plains. As one of them
wrote, acquaintance with this country for the first time ‘made
us realise the fearful odds that Buller had to tackle’; and no
doubt many other troopers went on fighting fanciful battles
against a wily enemy who, driven from one position, would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>gallop off to occupy another kopje still more formidable, and
so prolong that imaginary fight, while the train, like a
British column, wound its slow way through tortuous defiles.
Lumsden’s Horse, however, had eyes for other things also, as a
candid chronicler admits in his simple narrative, which may now
be allowed to run its uninterrupted course:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At several stations on our way there was the usual crowd of
‘loyal’ ladies of mature age, and the still larger crowd of schoolgirls.
The people seemed very glad to see us. There was a lot of cheering
and waving of handkerchiefs and pleasant greetings at every station.
They gave us cigarettes and cheroots, and some men were seen to be
sporting bows of red, white, and blue when we left—little attentions from
some fair hands in return perhaps for Lumsden’s badges, of which many
shoulder-straps were by that time bereft.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early next morning saw us at Cathcart, where we stopped about two
hours, and took the opportunity to water and feed our horses. There is a
nice little inn here, and we went down in a body and indulged in delicious
bread, butter, and milk. Oh, such a contrast to the same articles of
diet in India! The weather at this time of the year is nearly perfect,
the air being fine, dry, and invigorating; to the eye wearied by the flatness
of the plains of India the undulating country, small hills and green
valleys between, is very refreshing; but what strikes one, more especially
in the Free State, which we marched through later, is the desolateness
of the country, miles and miles of veldt dotted here and there with small
houses. Cattle-farming seems to be the principal thing they go in for
here, but the farmers say that, what with rinderpest and drought, it is very
disheartening work. The cattle are very fine, and strike us especially
coming from India, where one sees such miserable specimens. About
midday we arrived at Queen’s Town, and were very much disgusted to hear
that Lord Roberts had wired down that we were to detrain and go into
camp, as he needed all the horse-waggons and cattle-trucks for carrying
remounts (several thousands of which were collected at Queen’s Town) to
troops at the front. The camp is situated about two miles from the railway
station, but they have run a siding into it, so that the carriages containing
ourselves and our horses were simply detached from the rest of the train
and we were run into the camp. We did not take long in detraining and
picketing our horses; the poor brutes were simply delighted to get on
firm ground again, and when let loose indulged in all sorts of antics—rolling
on the grass, kicking up their heels, and larking like colts, to show
appreciation of their freedom. As our tents had not arrived yet, we
were obliged to sleep out in the open; but, knowing this would be
a matter of course sooner or later, we made no bones about it. Unfortunately
it came on to rain at night, and this made things generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>uncomfortable. The mufflers so kindly knitted for us by the ladies of
Calcutta proved simply invaluable; with these, Balaclava caps, and
greatcoats on, we made ourselves perfectly comfortable. There were
about twelve men of the Army Service Corps stationed here, and, with
the proverbial hospitality of Tommy Atkins, they very kindly supplied us
with hot cocoa and coffee, and offered to put up as many as possible of us
in their tents. We found several of the Queensland Mounted Volunteers
encamped here, also a part of the Militia Battalion of the Cheshires awaiting
marching orders like ourselves. Next day our tents arrived, and we were
soon quite settled down, ten men in a tent—a bit of a squash, but all right
when one gets accustomed to it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>There they may be left for a time chuckling over the good
story of a Militia regiment whose officers complained to Major
Showers that they could not stand the language of which
Lumsden’s Horse made such free and frequent use at ‘stables’
and other daily duties. Of course that language was only the
mildest of mild Hindustani put into terms of endearment with
certain genealogical references that sounded mysterious to the
uninitiated.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c005'>CHAPTER V <br /> <span class='small'><em>AN INTERLUDE—THE RESULTS OF SANNA’S POST</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At Maitland Camp and Queen’s Town the two companies of
Lumsden’s Horse would probably have remained many weary
weeks, eating their hearts out with the fever of impatience, but
for circumstances which must necessarily be explained at some
length in order to give a clear view of the general situation.
With events leading up to that situation Lumsden’s Horse had
nothing to do, but incidentally the crisis had a great deal to do
with them as influencing their movements immediately afterwards.
It will be remembered that Lord Roberts had found it
necessary to halt at Bloemfontein a fortnight earlier, his
victorious advance beyond that point being checked by the
loss of a very valuable convoy which had fallen into the hands
of the Boers at Waterval Drift. With characteristic cheerfulness
he made light of a mishap that would have been regarded
by many generals as almost disastrous in the circumstances,
seeing that the convoy contained supplies without which no
forward movement of troops beyond Bloemfontein would be
possible pending the repair of railways and the opening up of
communications with a secure base. In his despatches Lord
Roberts makes but a passing reference to the Waterval Drift
affair, as if it were of comparatively little importance, yet he
knew perfectly well that its consequences would be a temporary
paralysis of his whole force and heart-breaking delay at a time
when energetic action might have brought the campaign to
a decisive issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relief of Ladysmith, far from improving matters in this
respect, had simply set free a number of Boer commandos, whose
leaders, baulked in their ambitious schemes for the conquest of
Natal, were burning with desire to achieve successes in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Orange Free State. From their point of view it was still
possible to retrieve the disaster of Paardeberg, and they knew
that a severe blow struck at the British lines of communication
would bring them many adherents from Cape Colony who were
only waiting for such an opportunity. It would also inevitably
prolong the campaign by cutting off sources of supply, on which
Lord Roberts was dependent; and it might even turn the scale
in their favour by bringing about European intervention. To
that hope they clung always, as their State documents and correspondence
prove abundantly. Therefore it was of the first
importance that they should assume the offensive before Lord
Roberts could strengthen his lines of communication and bring
up ample supplies to form an advanced base at Bloemfontein.
If circumstances had permitted him to push on at once, the
moral effect on enemies already disorganised and disheartened
would have been enormous. As it was, his inaction revived the
drooping Spirits of Boers who were previously on the point of
accepting defeat as inevitable. They saw the inherent weakness
of a force that could not move far in any direction until the
means of feeding itself had been secured, and their thoughts
turned at once to the possibility of frustrating that object by
vigorous raids at every vulnerable point. In such an emergency
the presence of men like Louis Botha and Christian De Wet was
worth more than a thousand rifles. They had the brain to plan and
the intrepidity to attempt any enterprise that might bring them
an advantage by embarrassing their adversaries, and every day’s
delay on our side was an opportunity given to them for more
complete concentration. This last word must not be misunderstood.
When applied to Boer strategy or tactics it does not
necessarily mean,a gathering of units into one great force, but
rather a concentration of efforts on one object which they often
secure while seeming to aim at something entirely different by
a distribution of their commandos in many directions. Necessarily
such distracting operations can never bring about decisive
results, but they served the Boer purpose admirably then, and
De Wet got the opportunity he wanted to prove himself an ideal
leader for work of that kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>From some points of view this may be regarded as the most
important phase of the whole campaign; it taught the Boers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>how to harass our forces with the greatest effect while exposing
themselves to comparatively little danger. First of all, however,
they set themselves to the task of showing that there was life
and power for mischief in them yet, their object evidently being to
effect surprises that might create panic among our troops and so
render raids less difficult of accomplishment. In the development
of that idea we recognise the peculiar craft of Christian De Wet,
who at that time had less respect for the courage of ‘rooineks’
than he began to entertain soon afterwards. Sanna’s Post was a
lesson to him not less than to us. With the exaggeration which
characterised a great deal that was written in those days some
critics at home described this affair as a ‘black disaster,’ thereby
meaning apparently that it was something rather disgraceful and
a stain on our military reputation. A disaster it was in the
literal sense, for the stars in their courses seemed to be turned
against us; but they were certainly not blotted out, and they
never shone on soldiers whose deeds could better bear the light.
The story of Sanna’s Post or Koorn Spruit is worth telling again,
not only because it marks emphatically the revival of Boer hopes,
after Ladysmith and Paardeberg and Kimberley had done much
to shatter their self-confidence, but because it furnishes a splendid
example of British valour, defiant in the moment of defeat, and all
the brighter by contrast with the gloom through which it shines.
In details the following version of what happened may not be
more accurate than others, and it lacks the completeness that
subsequent access to official documents might have given; but
at least it has the merit of having been written at the time, and
of showing what was the impression conveyed to the minds of
people who were in the midst of those stirring events and could
gauge their significance without exaggeration. This description
by the Editor, who, as War Correspondent of ‘The Daily News,’
was then at Bloemfontein, may be given almost in its original
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>We knew that Colonel Pilcher, in attacking Ladybrand, had
roused a hornet’s nest, and that Brigadier-General Broadwood,
in command of a small mixed column, was retiring along that
road from Thaba ’Nchu, hard pressed by Boers, whom he could
only keep at a distance by the skilful disposition of his forces in
successive rearguard actions. His movements were hampered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>by the slow <a id='corr99.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='progess'>progress</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_99.1'><ins class='correction' title='progess'>progress</ins></a></span> of a convoy. He was falling back on a post
at Sauna’s near the waterworks from which Bloemfontein draws
its main supply, and expected to be there some time during the
night of Friday. He had made application for reinforcements
when the Boers, gathering strength as they came, began to
overlap him on each flank, in spite of anything that his men
could do to check every move of that kind. Thereupon Lord
Roberts sent General Colvile’s Division, with artillery, and
Colonel Martyr’s brigade of Mounted Infantry and Irregular
Horse eastward by a forced march. They left Bloemfontein
hours before daybreak on Friday, but even then it was too late.
Colonel Martyr, pushing on as fast as the condition of over-worked
horses would permit, only reached Boesman’s (or Bushman’s)
Kop with his leading troops about 7 o’clock. There
was still six miles of veldt between him and the scene of
disaster. Before he could cross that in force sufficient to be of
any use, the worst had happened, and nothing remained for him
but to cover the retreat of detachments that had already got
through the Boer lines before going to help those who were still
beset.</p>

<p class='c000'>What were the causes leading to disaster we did not know
then—we do not know with absolute certainty even now. No
special correspondents were with General Broadwood’s column
when sudden misfortune fell upon it. All details had to be
gathered at second hand, and many of the combatants who were
best qualified to give an impartial account of the trap in which
our troops were caught were either dead or prisoners in the hands
of the enemy. In the excitement following that swift surprise
those who had to fight hard for their lives could not see much
on either side of their immediate front. They were mainly
concerned with the necessity for shooting quick and straight.
It is therefore not surprising that stories of the fight, as seen
from many different points of view, should vary so that it
becomes a little difficult to follow the exact sequence of events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two or three points, however, seem tolerably clear. When
Brigadier-General Broadwood halted his troops to bivouac at
4 o’clock on Saturday morning, March 31, after crossing the
Modder River, they were worn out by a long night march that
had entailed incessant watchfulness. He was then in touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with the small force of Mounted Infantry holding the waterworks,
and, naturally supposing that their commander had taken all
precautions to safeguard the drift across Koorn Spruit, he did
not call upon his weary column to furnish additional patrols for
duty in that direction, but formed a chain of outposts along
ridges in rear towards the known enemy, who had been harassing
his march all the way from Thaba ’Nchu.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is known that the officer who was in command at Sanna’s
Post did take more than ordinary precautions before dawn that
morning by sending a company of Mounted Infantry westward
across the drift near Pretorius’s Farm, and, if a Boer prisoner
may be trusted, that very precaution contributed to the disaster.
According to his story, a party of three hundred Boers, who had

Cavalry, on Thursday, were making their way across country to

command on the Ladybrand side. Hearing Koorn Spruit, this
party saw the Mounted Infantry patrol, and, the first principle
of Boers in warfare being to hide themselves from the enemy,
they at once took shelter between the high banks of a water-course
which is, in places, nearly as dry as a khor in the
Soudan. Then they began to plan an ambush, with the object
of cutting off that isolated Mounted Infantry company. Until
that moment they had not thought of laying a trap for the
convoy, about which, indeed, they knew nothing. Such is the
story told by a Boer prisoner. If true, it proves that the capture
of Broadwood’s convoy was by a force entirely independent of
the one against which he had been fighting his rearguard
actions, and therefore unpremeditated, or, at any rate, not the
calculated result of skilful tactics.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first it was hastily assumed that one of the ablest scouts in
the British Army had been out-man&oelig;uvred, and allowed himself
to be surrounded by Boers. That the officer who gained distinction
for boldness, dash, and caution when reconnoitring successive
Dervish positions in the Soudan, should allow himself to be
caught in a trap by Boer farmers was almost inconceivable. It
now seems as if the enemy had merely stumbled on an opportunity,
of which they took advantage, not quite realising what
it meant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Against this, however, was the evidence of a civilian refugee
who declared that there were many more than three hundred
Boers concealed in Koorn Spruit, and believed that secret
information must have been given to them of the fact that no
force had been posted to guard the drift by which Broadwood’s
column must cross. On Pretorius’s Farm he met a burgher
who had given up his arms, and received a pass from our military
authorities permitting him to return to his home and settle down
in peace, secure from all fear of molestation at the hands of
British troops. This disarmed burgher, who had been fighting
against us up to the occupation of Bloemfontein by Lord Roberts,
showed such an accurate knowledge of the Boer movements that
he must have watched them very closely. He could tell the
exact position from which every gun would open fire on the
English, column before it came into action. This knowledge he
imparted without reserve, and yet, apparently, he had no apprehensions
of ill-treatment from his former comrades as the penalty
for deserting them. The incident, whatever interpretation may
be put upon it, is curious, and will, perhaps, help to explain
many things that happened when submissions were accepted and
passes granted with too lavish leniency.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is more than probable that a Boer attack on the waterworks
in order to destroy the pumping machinery there was part
of a plan conceived directly after the occupation of Bloemfontein
by our troops, but it could not be carried out before the column
holding Thaba ’Nchu had been forced to retire. The artillery
positions may therefore have been selected some time previously
for the purpose of shelling out any force that might make a
stand at the waterworks, and it is all consistent with the Boer
prisoner’s statement that no deliberate attempt was made by
General Broadwood’s pursuers to surround him until they found
that his convoy had been accidentally headed off and partly
destroyed at the drift across Koorn Spruit by a comparatively
small body lying in ambush there for another purpose. Such a
combination of accidents seems improbable, but certainly not
more so than the assumption that a Boer commander, calculating
all the chances to a nicety, had ventured to detach such a small
force and send it round by a wide <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>détour</em></span> across some miles of
open plain with the object of intercepting, by an ambush, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>column that had been able to hold its own against odds for some
time. If so, he gave more hostages to fortune than the Boers
have risked elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may be the truth in this respect, it is clear that
neither the officer in charge of communications, whose Mounted
Infantry held Sanna’s Post, nor Brigadier-General Broadwood,
had reason to suspect the presence of any hostile force in that
immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the retiring column got touch of its friends near the
waterworks, bivouac was immediately formed, and tired men no
sooner lay down, with saddles for pillows, and rifles by their
sides, than they were sound asleep, leaving the duty of watchfulness
to their rearguard, which, in outpost line, occupied a range
of rough hills southward, overlooking the road by which they
had retired from Thaba ’Nchu. It was then 4 o’clock. Little
time could be given to rest, for the column had to start again
in two hours. Just before 6 o’clock the convoy of a hundred
waggons with mule-teams began to move off towards Koorn
Spruit Drift. Such was the false sense of security that no
armed body went ahead. Some dismounted men, whose horses
had been shot or otherwise used up, marched as a baggage-guard,
but most of them had stowed their rifles on the waggons
while helping to get the column in marching order. Nothing
warned them that danger was near as they approached the drift.
Not a movement was to be seen across the broad veldt but dark
shadows of hills creeping backwards as the sun rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that moment, from a distant hill in rear, overtopping the
outpost ridge, darted the flash of a Boer gun, then another and
another from different positions, followed by the shriek of shells
and the crash of bursting charges. Every shot, well aimed,
struck with a dull thud, and threw up columns of earth among
or near the masses of men who were saddling up or inspanning
teams for the march, but did no damage beyond frightening mules
and increasing the confusion, where Cape boys, in their haste to
obey a peremptory order, got harness entangled and themselves
bewildered. Our Horse Artillery, being in a hollow, and masked
by the movement of troops about them, did not reply, but
limbered up and followed the transport waggons, which by that
time had begun to cross the drift. Nearly half of them had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>cleared it, when from behind steep banks in the winding spruit
on each side Boers galloped forward in dense troops, and, halting
with rifles at the present, summoned everybody to surrender.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some men of the baggage guard got to their arms, and, lying
between waggon wheels, opened fire, but they were few, and the
Boers many. The others, unarmed, could do nothing but obey
the stern mandate: ‘Hold up your hands; come this way and
give us your bandoliers.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Then U Battery of the Royal Horse Artillery, following close
upon the waggons, was surrounded before a gun could be wheeled
about for ‘Action front,’ and the drivers were ordered to dismount
and outspan. Gunners, however, do not yield without
a struggle, even when their eyes look into the barrel of an
enemy’s levelled rifle. Hands were on revolvers in an instant,
but before these could be drawn shooting had begun, and many
a gallant fellow fell. Horses, too, were shot down, or, being
wounded, plunged madly over the traces. One team, startled by
the din about it, stampeded, and galloped off with gun and
limber, but no drivers. Thus one gun was saved. The other
five fell into Boer hands, their gunners being either killed,
wounded, or taken prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sergeant-Major Martin escaped and ran back to warn Major
Hornby, who, in command of Q Battery, was then scarcely a
hundred yards from the scene of disaster. That officer gave the
order to unlimber and come into action, but could not open fire
while our men and the enemy were mixed up together among
baggage-waggons, and at the same time his own gunners were
being shot down. A small body of Remington’s Scouts made
one plucky effort to get near the captured battery, but suffered
heavily. Then two troops of Roberts’s Horse, acting as escort for
the convoy, dashed forward to cross the spruit and take the
Boers in flank, but they were confronted by enemies from
another ambush, who, at a distance of only a few yards, had
them covered and called upon them to surrender. Their only
answer was ‘Fours about—gallop’; but it came too late, and
before they could get out of range nearly every saddle was
emptied. Only five men got away, and of these four were
wounded. Among the missing, nine officers had either been
killed or fallen into the enemy’s hands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Emboldened by success, the Boers came into the open, as
they had never done before. They galloped up to groups of men
who were fighting shoulder to shoulder, reined in, and shot as
they sat in the saddle, reckless of the bullets that whistled about
them. One body charged close up to a Maxim gun that was
pouring out a deadly torrent of bullets, and silenced it for a time
by shooting down the detachment, but whether they got away or
fell victims to their own bravery could not be seen as the struggle
surged round them. Three New Zealanders whom I met coming
out of the fight told the story, and spoke with admiration of the
daring displayed by many of their foes, but still more enthusiastically
of the splendid courage of our Horse Artillery. Of these
three, one was a fine type of the half-caste Maori, the others
hardy Colonists, who looked as if they had faced death more
than once—cold-eyed and calm. They had evidently taken
mental note of all that passed within sight of them, while they
with others held a group of buildings, keeping the enemy in check
by steady shooting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Hornby, finding that he could not bring his guns to
bear at short range without shooting down friend as well as foe,
limbered up to get clear of the close <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>mêlée</em></span>. In wheeling round
on rough ground one gun capsized, bringing all the team down
with it—horses and drivers together in a confused mass. The
Boers saw their chance, and brought a withering rifle fire to bear,
so that every attempt to right the gun failed. Under this fire
the two wheelers of another team fell. The leaders struggled on
for a time, dragging their maimed comrades, then came to a standstill,
and that gun also had to be left behind. Marksmen of the
Durham Light Infantry did their best to keep down the enemy’s
fire, while volunteers ran out to help the distressed gunners, who,
managing to escape, went off for fresh horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Gore Anley, commanding the Essex Regiment’s
Mounted Infantry, aided by two of his men, brought a wounded
gunner from under that terrific fire to safety, and then went out
with a brother-officer to help at the guns. Time after time the
artillerymen brought up fresh teams, which were shot down
before they could be hooked to the limbers. One driver had
nine horses killed or wounded before he gave up the attempt as
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Meanwhile Major Hornby, with four guns of his own command,
and the only one remaining of U Battery, which had been recaptured
after stampeding, moved southward to a position twelve
hundred yards from Koorn Spruit Drift. There he brought them
into action with a cool audacity and effect that paralysed the
enemy. Though he could not save the guns that had been left
behind, he could cover the retirement of Cavalry and Mounted
Infantry of the rearguard, who, unable longer to hold the low
ridge against heavy odds, were being forced back from the waterworks,
fighting stubbornly, though threatened in flank by the
force that had captured our convoy. Shelled at from right and
left, smitten by storms of rifle bullets, the gunners of Q Battery
never budged. Coolly, as if at target practice, they loaded and
aimed. The shells burst among the Boers, checking more than
one attempt at a rush, and then the remnants of a shattered
brigade were enabled to retire upon their supports, who had
rallied for a stand at the station buildings.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the time officers and men of the Army Medical Corps
were covering themselves with honour by brilliant services
rendered to stricken soldiers, who lay helpless where the ground
was torn by bullets. The coolest deed of all, however, was done
by an American named Todd, a trooper in Roberts’s Horse.
With a comrade he had first volunteered to go out and bring in
some stray horses for the disabled guns. Before they had ridden
fifty yards the second trooper was shot dead, but Todd galloped on
straight towards the Boers, rounded up both horses, and had
nearly brought them back when one was killed. When he rejoined
his detachment Todd heard an officer asking for volunteers to go
out in search of their doctor, who was lying wounded in a donga.
Without waiting to hear more the trooper turned his horse’s head
towards the Boer lines again and galloped off. Twenty minutes
later he rode back slowly, bearing a heavy burden on his arms.
‘I couldn’t see the doctor anywhere,’ he said, ‘but I have
brought back the only wounded man that I found alive there.’
If ever a man earned the right to wear the grim badge of Roberts’s
Horse it is Trooper Todd. Deeds of heroism, however, were not
rare that day. They could not avert disaster, but they shed a
light upon it that dispels the shadow of humiliation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our men had still hard fighting to do before they could hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to extricate themselves. Brigadier-General Broadwood’s retirement
upon the station buildings was not effected without difficulty,
and it is wonderful that he should have been able to keep
the remnants of so many broken squadrons in hand, while they
were weakened by further losses every minute, and the on-coming
enemy gathered strength. Several horsemen, escaping, got
away across the veldt, and then, forming groups, headed towards
Boesman’s Kop, Boers pursuing for some distance. But the
main body made a stand at the station buildings, and fought it
out for two weary hours, so fiercely that the enemy did not dare
to come to closer quarters. The company of Burmese Mounted
Infantry that had been on outpost duty west of Koorn Spruit,
when they found themselves cut off by Boers in ambush, made
an attempt to rejoin the main body, but were in turn surrounded.
Having some advantage of ground, though outnumbered, they
were enabled to hold their assailants off until 7 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the scene changed. Troops appeared on Boesman’s
Kop. They were the advanced guard of Colonel Martyr’s
Mounted Infantry brigade, which had made a forced march to
relieve the beleaguered column. Their commander halted only
long enough to let the main body close up, and then ‘Queenslanders
to the rescue’ came sweeping across the veldt as fast as
their jaded horses could move. But the Boers were at their old
tactics again, and the Queensland Mounted Infantry fell into a
trap skilfully laid for them. Before the enemy could reap much
advantage, however, Colonel Henry was at them with all his
companies of Regular Mounted Infantry, which the astute
Brigadier had ordered forward when he saw the Queensland men
in difficulties. The young officer, who has spent many years
with Egyptian Camel Corps, chasing Dervish raiders and scouting
about their strongholds, was not to be caught by a Boer
ambush. He advanced upon them in a formation too flexible
even for their mobility, and gradually drove them before him
until the Burmese and Queensland Mounted Infantry were
enabled to fight their way through the weakened cordon.</p>

<p class='c000'>This timely diversion gave General Broadwood his opportunity,
Major Hornby’s battery fell back to another position, covering
the retirement, and then the column, leaving its wounded under
care of our own surgeons, retired slowly to join the welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>reinforcements. They had to turn again and again to face the
foe, who still hung on their heels, and all the way they were
shelled by Boer guns, until a final stand was made near the
waterworks, where the enemy dared not attack, though the
artillery fire continued for nearly two hours longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late that afternoon the Highland Brigade, under General
Hector MacDonald, passed Boesman’s Kop, and advanced to get
touch of the enemy, near Modder River; but except for a few
shells and sputtering rifle fire, no attempt was made by the Boers
to resist this advance. When General Smith-Dorrien’s brigade,
and other troops of the Ninth Division, joined MacDonald, the
column that had fought so well after disaster fell upon it, dispersed
into scattered remnants once more, each unit making for
the appointed bivouac in any want of formation best adapted to
the needs of weary men who had to walk because their horses
were more tired than themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a roll-call it would have been if the Brigadier had not
in mercy spared them that melancholy ordeal! When the losses
came to be counted, they numbered, in dead, wounded, and
prisoners, nearly a third of the force that had marched out of
Thaba ’Nchu forty hours earlier. Of U Battery, Royal Horse
Artillery, only a mere handful remained, and Q Battery had
suffered heavily too. Seven out of twelve guns had been left in
the enemy’s hands, with some eighty baggage waggons full of
stores. Household Cavalry, 10th Hussars, and Mounted
Infantry had losses to mourn, and Roberts’s Horse the most of
all. Unhappily, it was too late to hope that either guns or
convoy could be recaptured. They had all been taken off during
the afternoon towards Thaba ’Nchu, and Boers were in possession
of the waterworks, with artillery on heights behind, covering
the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day a demonstration of the whole force under General
Colvile’s command was made, as if to drive every Boer from the
waterworks, where mischief had been done by the destruction of
pumping engines; but it ended in nothing, and then we gradually
drew in our forces. The Boers assumed the offensive again, and
began to threaten our line of communications at several points.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were the conditions that made Lord Roberts anxious
to secure the services of every mounted corps on which he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>rely for meeting the new Boer tactics by swift counter-strokes.
Most of them he had foreseen when orders were sent for
Lumsden’s Horse to be supplied with all the remounts necessary
for repairing losses and pushed on to the front. Sanna’s Post
with all its consequences had not been counted on; but it made
the need for mounted troops all the more urgent in order that
pressure round about Wepener might be relieved and lines of communication
cleared. That action, lamentable because of the
sacrifices it entailed, but glorious in its heroic incidents, gave to
Lumsden’s Horse not only an opportunity, but an example; and
we may be sure that, when the news reached them at Maitland
Camp and at Queen’s Town, every trooper made up his mind to
be a worthy comrade of the men who had risked their lives so
nobly and fought with such stubborn valour in vain attempts to
save the guns at Sanna’s Post.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A week was more than enough in which to exhaust all the
charms that A Company could find round about its dusty camp
at Maitland. The fragrance from woodland belts of pine and
eucalyptus trees soon began to pall; there was little to refresh the
eye in that changeless view across unbroken flats, where a grey
haze hung morning, noon, and eve, veiling the distant mountains
northward; the beauty of Table Mountain, as seen from there,
with kloof-fretted steeps towering up to the clouds, is not a joy
for ever; and Cape Town shows its least attractive side towards
Maitland, which in itself is the embodiment of suburban
dreariness, having but two places of entertainment—a swimming
bath and an observatory. As admission to the latter can only
be gained by a special permit from the Astronomer Royal,
Lumsden’s Horse had few opportunities to appreciate the wild
dissipation of ascending its quaint old tower, which, indeed,
most of them mistook for a dismantled windmill. And the
amusements that Cape Town offers to soldiers of less than commissioned
rank had few temptations for troopers of Lumsden’s
Horse. Mount Nelson, with its gay crowd of fair women and
maimed heroes, was to them but a vision of the life that had
been. How those dainty damsels would have been shocked to
see a trooper in weather-stained khaki and ammunition boots
treading the glades and terraced heights of that South African
Olympus! But not more shocked than a man of Lumsden’s
Horse would have felt at finding himself in such a situation.
Ridiculous prejudice, of course, and to be condemned by all right-thinking
people in whose opinion the soldier’s uniform is a badge
of honour. Yes! but like many other badges it has to be worn
with a difference; and nobody knows better than those who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>tried the experiment of putting it on that a private soldier’s service
kit is not the garb in which one would choose to appear where
fashion and beauty congregate. A man may have served through
a whole campaign in the lowest ranks, obedient to every command,
however humiliating or distasteful, and not have felt the
yoke gall him half so sorely as it does when he first realises the
social inferiority that it implies. Let us have done with cant
and confess at once that a man who puts on the common soldier’s
uniform for active service, whether he be Volunteer or Regular,
thereby renounces all claims to the rights and privileges of a
gentleman. The gay haunts of a city are not for him then, if he
cherishes his self-respect, and the troopers of Lumsden’s Horse
had that truth impressed upon them long before their week of rest
at Cape Town came to an end. They were no more squeamish
than others, and their experiences in this direction have been
shared by every Yeomanry corps and Volunteer detachment,
after the first burst of enthusiasm on their account exhausted
itself. Cheerful endurance of these things may be counted not
least among the merits of men who gave up much to serve their
country in her hour of need, and to ignore them would be to
misunderstand the nature of many sacrifices made by the rank-and-file
of a regiment like Lumsden’s Horse. In times more
propitious they would have appreciated fully all the charms that
Cape Town can offer; but, as it was, the parting had no great
pang for them, and A Company hailed with unalloyed delight the
order for an advance northward into the land of infinite possibilities.
There was to be no route marching for that detachment,
the Cape Colony lines being comparatively clear of troop traffic;
so that the prospect of reaching Bloemfontein by rail without
serious interruption seemed almost a certainty. It was on Friday,
March 30, that Colonel Lumsden received, direct from headquarters,
the welcome intimation that he and his two companies
were wanted at the front. Colonel Lumsden naturally felt
himself very fortunate in receiving orders by which his corps
was chosen for active service while Regular regiments and
Yeomanry companies waited impatiently at the base in Cape
Town; but Lord Roberts needed mounted troops more than
infantry just then. Everybody accepted this as the first real
step of the great march on which their hearts were set, and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>crowning triumph at Pretoria. They were not to be out of it
after all. And we may be sure that they wanted no second call
when the warning came for them to get their kits packed and be
ready for a start by train the next morning. This was glad
news for all except four unfortunate troopers who, much to their
sorrow, had to be left in hospital at Cape Town. These were
James Lee-Stewart, of whose case Colonel Lumsden wrote a week
or so earlier; Knyvitt Boileau, of Tyrhoot; Hubert Noel Shaw, of
Palumpur; and John Canute Doyle, of the Transport Detachment.
Of others, who were invalids on the voyage, Howard Hickley had
quite recovered, and Clayton-Daubeny, pleading hard that he was
quite fit to ride and shoot, in spite of a broken collar-bone, got
permission to rejoin his section for duty. So keen were the men
to be near the fighting line that they have hardly recorded their
impressions of the strange country through which they passed;
and but for an incidental note here and there, like the opening
paragraph of the following letter, we might almost imagine that
profound peace reigned throughout the country. Yet the letter
was dated only three days after our troops had suffered so
heavily at Sanna’s Post. Writing on the morning of April 3, a
trooper whose letters were sent to the ‘Englishman’ said:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>It is wonderful to think that this very afternoon we shall be in
Bloemfontein, and may see the great old man whose masterly tactics have
so completely turned the tide of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Friday we heard the line was clear, and this news was quickly
followed by a warning to hold ourselves in readiness. Immediately on
top came the order to be at the railway station the following day by
1 o’clock. A mighty packing up of kit and piling up of supplies resulted
in a successful transference of our goods and chattels to the station by the
appointed time, and at 6 o’clock we steamed out of Cape Town in two
trains, one following the other. When we left camp ammunition was
served out, fifty rounds a man, and the weight of it has not added to our
comfort.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railway journey has proved very pleasant so far. However, some
slight description of how we are packed aboard may be interesting. We
heard, with no little misgiving, that we were to be eight in a compartment,
for we expected nothing but the ordinary straight-backed wooden
carriage, and no chance of lying down at all during the three days to be
occupied in journeying to the Free State capital. So it was a pleasant
surprise to find first-class corridor carriages comfortably upholstered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>leather, with sleeping accommodation in each compartment for four men
at a time. There were one or two second-class carriages equally comfortable,
with the additional advantage of an extra tier of berths, accommodating
six sleepers, one on the floor and one in the passage, and the
whole boiling of us slept the sleep of the just the whole night through.
Rations consisted of tinned corned beef and biscuits, suspiciously like dog
biscuits, but good to eat nevertheless—for people with sharks’ teeth and
stomachs of brass. But nearly everywhere we stopped there were coffee-shops,
where you paid sixpence for everything, and an ordinary chota
hazri sort of meal ran up to about half-a-crown. As we travel up country
we find everything very dear, and we wonder Government does not
make some effort to arrange that the troops should be supplied with
tinned goods at reasonable prices. If private contractors can get stuff
up, certainly Government, which has first call on the railways, can too.</p>

<p class='c000'>The horses—poor devils!—are packed ten, eleven, and twelve in a
cattle-truck, and the way they kick at times is a caution. All along the
train the trucks are broken and splintered. Oh! for the luxury of our
Indian horseboxes. However, three times a day we manage to feed and
water the poor brutes, and though their meals are somewhat scratch
they don’t do so badly. Forage is of the best—splendid compressed hay,
and English oats and bran.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Aar was the first place of real interest we came to, and there we
beheld a battered armoured train, covered with bullet marks. Then we
touched at Naauwpoort, which was crowded with soldiers. The train stopped
just opposite Rensburg, so we got out and had a game of football, with an
empty tin for ball and broken saddles for goal-posts, right on the place
where the battle of Rensburg had been fought a few months previously.
From there we could see the flat-topped broken cone of Cole’s Kop rising
from a rock-roughened plain like a huge step-pyramid, with sheer escarpments,
up which the Naval Brigade hauled two fifteen-pounders by means
of a wire rope, and struck terror into the Boers at Colesberg when those
guns opened fire from that apparently inaccessible height. Afterwards
came Norval’s Pont, where we prepared to cross the Orange River.
Unluckily, we crossed at 1 in the morning, when very little could be
seen. It is wonderful how the Sappers have repaired the bridge. We
spun across in pontoons with the water swirling within two feet of us.
Shortly after crossing the river we were halted and ordered to draw another
fifty rounds of ammunition per man, and to post two sentries to each
carriage; every man to wear his bandolier, have his rifle handy, and
be ready to turn out at a moment’s notice. Firing had been heard that
evening, and there was no doubt Boers were in the vicinity. Later, some
thirty miles south of Bloemfontein, we heard that the troops stationed to
protect the railway line had been out in the surrounding kopjes during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the night, and that a Boer commando, 600 strong, had been seen travelling
south. So we are bang in the thick of it now, and ere many more hours
have passed we shall be within sound of the firing, for we hear fighting is
going on steadily to the north of Bloemfontein. The men are in splendid
spirits and health, and wild to get a turn at the enemy. Altogether we
have every reason to congratulate ourselves on the comfortable and speedy
journey we have made to the front.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The man who could regard De Aar—sun-scorched, arid, dust-stifled
De Aar—as the first place of interest on that long railway
journey, simply because an armoured train ‘covered with bullet
marks’ was standing in the station, must have been in a very
warlike frame of mind indeed. But perhaps the comfortable
railway travelling, so conducive to the ‘sleep of the just,’ may
account for much. Probably the slumberous heat of afternoon
had caused him to doze before the train slowed down at Stellenbosch,
which was a place of much notoriety at the time; and
picturesque, too, with its great oak avenues, dating from a day
when Commandant Van der Stel, the planter of them, was there
with his young wife in the very foreposts of Dutch civilisation,
not much more than thirty miles from Cape Town; and more
picturesque still because of its quaint thatched houses as old as
the oaks. Stellenbosch is a great centre of education, and,
according to the guide-books, it has a home for the training of a
limited number of poor whites. We know the ‘poor whites’ for
whose training a home was provided at Stellenbosch about the
time when A Company of Lumsden’s Horse passed that way and
afterwards. They were mostly officers of high rank who had
not distinguished themselves, and for whom a refuge had to be
found where they could do no greater mischief than send useless
remounts from that depôt to the front. So Stellenbosch grew in
repute, and visits to it (without return tickets) were so frequent,
that an expressive verb had to be coined for use in everyday
conversation. The phrase ‘I’ll be Stellenbosched if I do,’
became quite familiar, and many a gallant officer knew to his
cost what it meant. Rustication in that old Dutch settlement
under leafy arcades, where, in ordinary times, ‘the stillness of
the cloisters reigns,’ was not the only penalty. These, however,
were things not known to recent arrivals like Lumsden’s Horse,
who might have met and hobnobbed with the latest candidate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>for Stellenbosch and have been none the wiser. So they went
on their way thinking nothing of the old Dutch town and its
new notoriety, and in the darkness of night, when the new moon
showed no more than a crescent thread of silver, were winding
by sharp curves and steep gradients up the kloofs of Hex River
Mountains towards the Great Karroo. Lumsden’s troopers saw
little of the glorious landscape that is opened up at that height.
Those who were not asleep had no light to see it by but the cold
light of the stars, and that seemed to be swallowed up in the
depths of impenetrable shadow, except where the lamps of
Worcester Town, in the plains 2,500 feet below, twinkled like
feeble reflections on a wine-dark sea. Then the swift dawn
came, and when the sun rose they were crossing the Great
Karroo, which at that time of year—the true winter of Cape
Colony—wore its least attractive garb. Bare patches of sandy
soil gaped between scattered clumps of blue-green scrub, where
a month or so later it would be glowing with the purple and gold
and scarlet flowers of lilies and asters innumerable, and the
gorgeous crowns of mesembryanthemums of every conceivable
shade, from white through primrose and orange to the deepest
crimson. In its winter state the Great Karroo brings back to
travellers of wide African experience clear memories of the
Northern Soudan. In all chief physical features the two regions,
so widely separated, are curiously alike. Here are pyramidal
mountains with flat-topped crowns rising wall-like above the
conical base exactly resembling the ‘Jebels’ on which one has
looked with weary eyes, day after day, through the rippling heat
of the Soudan deserts. In some parts of the Karroo these
mountains close upon narrow gorges, along which the railway
winds, and its sudden turns round rocky buttresses seem so
familiar to one who knows the old military line above Wady
Halfa that he can imagine himself travelling once more through
the desolate Batn el Hagar towards Khartoum. To men for
whom the rugged Karroo had no such associations with the land
of mysterious fascination, there may well have been a wearisome
monotony in the unvarying repetition of similar forms—the vast
plains whereon no tree bigger than the <em>Acacia horrida</em> grows,
and where the houses, if any, are so widely separated that they
only serve to deepen the impression of melancholy solitude;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the waterless rivers, the bare brown kops. For full appreciation
of the Karroo one must have breathed its invigorating air from
childhood, and seen it in seasons of beauty with all the glory of
its summer raiment on. De Aar Junction is no more than a huge
collection of railway sheds and equally hideous houses set in the
most barren plain of the Great Karroo; but Lumsden’s Horse
saw it busy with many signs of military preparation for a forward
movement, and so it seemed to them the very gateway of the
fateful future, in the shaping of which they were to have a hand.
That night they crossed the Orange River at Norval’s Pont,
where Railway Pioneers, mostly skilled artificers from the
Johannesburg mines, under Major Seymour—‘the greatest of
mechanical engineers,’ as Colonel Girouard styled him—were
hard at work, night and day, repairing the broken bridge, while
baggage was being transferred by the wire trolly high overhead.
Lumsden’s Horse crossed the pontoon ‘deviation’ to a train on
the farther side, and when morning dawned they were journeying
slowly—with many precautions against possible surprises
by marauding Boers—to the goal of their hopes. Bloemfontein
was reached by A Company in the afternoon of April 3, when
they went into camp at Rustfontein, two miles from the town,
and became part of the 8th M.I. Regiment, under the command
of that very able leader, Colonel ‘Watty’ Ross, whose portrait
appears on the opposite page. Of him Colonel Lumsden writes:
‘No better man could have been chosen to command a body
of Irregular Horse. Capable, tactful, with a keen eye for a
country, and a man hard to beat in the saddle, he was in fact
an ideal leader at the game he had to play. We were under his
command from the time the 8th M.I. was formed at Bloemfontein,
early in April 1900, taking part in every action of that
eventful march to Pretoria, and the 8th M.I. had the honour of
scouting in front of headquarters throughout.’ After the memorable
June 5, when the capital of the South African Republic fell
into our hands, Lumsden’s Horse were placed for some time on
communications at Irene and Kalfontein, but their Colonel,
tiring of this inaction, applied to General Smith-Dorrien for
more congenial employment. His wish was shortly afterwards
gratified, and Lumsden’s Horse, with mutual regrets on both
sides, were transferred to another column, thus severing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>connection with the 8th M.I. and the leader whose soldierly
qualities had endeared him to all ranks. Their respect for him
found appropriate expression long afterwards, when every man
of the corps, from Colonel Lumsden downwards, subscribed for a
badge, the regimental ‘LH’ in diamonds, and this they presented
to Mrs. Ross in token of their admiration for her husband as a
commander and in appreciation of the considerate kindness he
had shown to all ranks while they served under him. That the
admiration was not all on one side may be gathered from an
incident that occurred some time after Lumsden’s Horse were
embodied with the 8th Mounted Infantry Corps, and Colonel
Lumsden thinks justly that no better proof could be given of the
able and smart class of men he had in his command than the
following remark from Colonel Ross: ‘Lumsden, whenever I
ask you to send me an A.D.C. or galloper, never mind sending
me one of your officers; your troopers are just the class I
want.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Some months after the severance of associations that had
been so pleasant for commander and commanded, when Lumsden’s
Horse had seen their last of South African fighting, Colonel
Ross had the lower part of his face shattered by a bullet while
attacking a Boer position at Bothaville with the gallant dash
which his old comrades remember so well. In that fight De Wet’s
forces were completely routed, and lost nearly all their artillery;
but the victory was not achieved without heavy sacrifices on our
side. Colonel Le Gallais, who commanded the Mounted Infantry,
and also Captain Williams, formerly Staff-Officer of the 8th M.I.
Corps under Colonel Ross, were killed, while going to the assistance
of their brother-officer; and, in the same fight, Lieutenant
Percy Smith, who had gained honours as a trooper of Lumsden’s
Horse at Ospruit when he went out with his Colonel to bring in
a helpless comrade, was wounded in the performance of a gallant
action by which he won the D.S.O.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the sake of finishing a story events have been somewhat
anticipated, and B Company may resent the interpolation, at this
stage, of a flattering comment that belongs properly to a later
period. In the actions from which Colonel Ross formed his
high opinion of Lumsden’s troopers, B Company had taken its
full share. Before resuming touch with the movements of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>body, however, reference must be made to another incident in
which A Company had the proud distinction of representing the
whole corps. The occasion was a visit on April 4 by Lord
Roberts, who, after inspecting the company, called out and
shook hands with Trooper Hugh Blair, whose brother, an
officer of the Royal Engineers, had been badly wounded in the
Candahar campaign. The Commander-in-Chief then made a brief
speech to Colonel Lumsden and his troopers. Of this no shorthand
note or transcription from mental tablets seems to have been
made, but its meaning is probably expressed in the following
letter which Lord Roberts wrote to Sir P. Playfair, C.I.E.,
Chairman of the Executive Committee of Lumsden’s Horse:
‘Dear Sir Patrick,—Many thanks for your letter of February 26.
A few evenings ago I had great pleasure in inspecting Lumsden’s
Horse immediately after their arrival here. I sent a telegram to
the Viceroy to inform him that I had done so. They are a
workmanlike, useful lot. I am sure they will do splendidly in
whatever position they may be placed. It is most gratifying to
hear the way in which the corps was raised. The sum subscribed
by the public generally is the proof of the patriotism of
the subscribers, especially Colonel Lumsden himself. You will
have seen in the papers that we are detained here for a while
until we can refit, but when this is done we shall move northward.
I am confident that during our advance Lumsden’s Horse
will do credit to themselves and to India. Believe me, yours
very truly, (Signed) <span class='sc'>Roberts</span>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days after that inspection the Commander-in-Chief
sent to Colonel Lumsden a telegram he had received from the
Viceroy. Lord Roberts’s secretary wrote as follows: ‘Dear
Colonel Lumsden,—The Field-Marshal asks me to send you the
enclosed telegram from the Viceroy, and to say that he fully
agrees with the last sentence of it.—Yours sincerely, H.V.
Cowan, Colonel, Military Secretary.’ Lord Curzon’s telegram
said: ‘Lord Roberts, Bloemfontein.—We are delighted to hear
of your kind reception of our Indian Volunteer contingent, and
hope that they may have a chance of going to the front, where
we are confident of their ability to distinguish themselves.—<span class='sc'>Viceroy.</span>’</p>

<p class='c000'>Carrying on the narrative from this point, but leaving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>lighter incidents of life in Bloemfontein for other pens to chronicle,
Colonel Lumsden deals briefly in his diary with the remaining
period of A Company’s isolation, and brings it down to the day
when the corps was to be reunited under his command. With
natural gratification at the position assigned to him, he says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>General Ian Hamilton is to command a division of 10,000 Mounted
Infantry, of which Colonel Ridley’s brigade forms nearly a half, consisting
of four corps of about 1,200 strong each. We are embodied with
the 8th Mounted Infantry Corps, consisting of Loch’s Horse, ourselves,
and various companies of Mounted Infantry from Regular battalions,
under the command of Colonel Ross. Both Colonels Ridley and Ross are
well known in India, and we are fortunate in being under their command
and in having such a dashing divisional commander as General Ian
Hamilton. Our first camp in Bloemfontein proved a sickly one, water
being scarce owing to the Boers having blown up the waterworks and
cut off the main supply. This, no doubt, has been the cause of numerous
cases of dysentery, and our camp was shifted yesterday to a healthier
locality, with a more plentiful water supply. Strange to say, we have
had an attack of mumps among the men, emanating, we believe, from
a native servant who developed that disease on board ship. I regret to
say that Captain Beresford had to be taken to hospital yesterday, suffering
from an acute attack of dysentery; but a few days of careful dieting will
enable him to rejoin us, I hope. B Company, owing to the congested
state of the railway traffic from Cape Town to Bloemfontein, was landed
at East London, to proceed thence by rail to join us. Transport, however,
was found to be equally difficult by that route, and in consequence
the company had to march the greater part of the way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>What meanwhile had befallen that force under the command
of Major Showers may be told in the words of a trooper whose
lively contributions to the ‘Indian Daily News’ do not seem to
have been regarded as an infringement of a rule laid down in
the mobilisation scheme by which volunteers for Lumsden’s
Horse were warned that they would on no account be allowed to
act as special correspondents for newspapers. This regulation,
like many others, seems to have been more honoured in the
breach than the observance. Taking up the broken thread
where it was dropped some pages back, he writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At Queen’s Town we had a fairly pleasant time, except on nights when
it simply rained cats and dogs and hailed as well. Most of our tents leaked
badly, so we were rendered thoroughly uncomfortable. The horses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the unfortunate stable pickets (I was one, and speak from personal experience)
were in a wretched plight, without shelter of any kind. When
the storms were at their worst, and picketing pegs would not hold in
the soft ground, we may have used words that were not endearing to
horses that got loose. On April 2 we were told that the company would
start on the 4th, marching to Bethulie, waggons for our horses not being
available then, but that we should probably entrain a few stations further
up. We were informed that all superfluous clothing, &amp;c., would have to
be packed up and returned to East London, and each man would only be
allowed to take one kit bag, weight not to exceed thirty pounds. We
therefore set to work, and cudgelled our brains trying to decide what to
take and what to leave behind—no easy task, I can tell you. However,
the die was cast at last, and we were ready for kit-bag weighing next
morning. Several of the men had evidently rather vague ideas on this
point, and, after filling their bags to a weight of forty or fifty pounds each,
had to repack them, much to their disgust. We left next day, our
destination being Baileytown, a small place about thirteen miles distant.
We were all, of course, in full marching order—supplied with water-bottles,
haversacks, bandoliers, rifles, and corn-bag. The first three were
hung round our shoulders, the rifles in the bucket on the off side of the
saddle, and the corn-bag slung to the saddle. I was not accustomed
to it; the strain on the shoulders is pretty severe; and we were all glad
when Baileytown drew in sight. This march gave us a very good opportunity
of examining the country, and as we passed kopje after kopje it
was very easy to realise how difficult a task it is to dislodge the Boers from
their veritable strongholds. Arriving at Baileytown about 5 p.m., and
finding no tents there, we bivouacked, and found the bare veldt no such
uncomfortable bed after all. We spent the whole of the next day there,
and as very good grass was plentiful on the slope of the hills the opportunity
was taken of knee-haltering and grazing the horses. Resumed
our march next day; did about twenty-two miles by 3 o’clock in the afternoon,
when a halt was made at a place called Sterkstroom. Here, to our
delight, orders came for us to be sent off at once by train. We spent a
very busy afternoon unloading kits from the transport carts and reloading
them into railway waggons, and entraining horses. The animals seem
to be getting reconciled to this constant training and detraining, and
behaved very well indeed. By 8.30 we were all ready to board the train.
No more luxurious second- and third-class carriages for us poor privates
now. We were packed like sardines in a box into three covered trucks,
about forty or fifty men in each. It was quite dark, and no lanterns were
given us, or, rather, there was an apology for a lantern in our truck, but
it hardly made darkness visible; kits and men all over the place, and little,
if any, room to sleep—a very weary night indeed for most of us. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>arrived at Burghersdorp at 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> next day, and stayed there about two
hours. All sorts of rumours were current about the close proximity of
the Boers. We were informed that fighting was expected at a station
north of Bethulie. At this latter place the troops had slept in the trenches
all night in momentary expectation of an attack. There were said to be
three or four thousand Boers hovering round in the hills adjacent to these
places, having been cut off in an attempt to retreat beyond Bloemfontein.
We did not reach Bethulie till 8 o’clock that evening, having to wait at
various sidings for down trains, of which there were a good many. Not
expecting to detrain till the following morning, we had made ourselves as
comfortable as circumstances permitted for the night when orders were
issued to get out and encamp close by at once. In a moment all was
excitement, orders ringing out constantly, and men hurriedly getting their
kit together—an almost hopeless task in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, it was not long before all the men, horses, and kit were out
and on their way to camp. Arrived there, we picketed the animals, and
by 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> had quite settled down for the night. No peace for us, however,
as orders went round that we must be ready saddled by 4.30, in case our
services should be required. It turned out to be a false alarm, however, so
after waiting till 8 o’clock we took the horses out to exercise. Bethulie,
straggling along the northern bank of Orange River, is just on the borders
of the Free State. The railway bridge, an eight-span one, has been
completely destroyed by Boers, and I must say they have done their work
very cleanly; five out of the eight spans have been cut right through by
charges of dynamite. Fortunately, however, there is a waggon bridge here
also, which reinforcements, coming up in time, were enabled to save from
destruction, and, lines having been placed across this, one truck at a time
is taken over. This important point of communication is now very
strongly guarded by regiments of Infantry on each side of the river.
Nearly all of us took the opportunity of having a glorious bath in the
river, and did a little amateur clothes-washing. Practice will make
perfect, no doubt, but at present we don’t take very kindly to it. At
3 in the afternoon we got orders to saddle up in readiness to march
as an escort to 600 transport mules for Bloemfontein. The rearguard
came on with our own transport, and, as the latter only move very slowly,
they marched all night and did not arrive at Spytfontein—the halting-place,
nineteen miles distant—till about 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> Fortunately, there was
brilliant light from the new moon; otherwise the slow progress with refractory
mules would have been dreary indeed. As it was, we marched
along as silently as possible, and had the feeling that we might be attacked
at any moment. The Kaffir drivers, however, could not be restrained
from shouting in shrillest notes and cracking their long rhinoceros-hide
thongs with sounds like rifle-shots as they ran to head off wayward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>stragglers. All night long the red dust rose from the hoofs of those 600
mules in stifling clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a most desolate-looking country, miles beyond miles without
passing a single human habitation. Towards the end of the march,
whether through sheer exhaustion or from the effects of the moonbeams
(one of our sages started this theory next day), half the men went to
sleep in their saddles. I was one of the somnolent ones, and my horse
took me several yards in front of the main body, and I awoke with a start
to hear my companions silently chuckling at the situation. The only
remedy was to get off and march alongside our horses, and several of
us did this. Natives told us afterwards that Boers had been hanging on
our flanks all through that march, and the only thing that saved us was
our water-cart, which they mistook for a gun-carriage. The Boers must
have changed a good deal since then if they could be so easily deceived.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Spytfontein about 7 o’clock that morning and arrived at
Springfontein at 3 in the afternoon. Here the orders were for us to
start again next morning, escorting a Maxim battery of four guns to
Bloemfontein, in addition to the 600 mules we already had under convoy.
I may mention that one section of our company always acted as advance
guard, throwing out scouts in front and on the flanks; the duty of these
scouts being to search the kopjes on either side of the road, and communicate
with the main body by hand signals should any enemy appear
in sight. Starting from Springfontein early on April 10, we did a
march of fifteen miles to Jagersfontein. Here Jim, having pity for my
lameness, took my horse to water while I, in return, prowled round and
found a little house where the womenfolk agreed to let us have tea.
I was shown into the drawing-room, which looked very cosy by comparison
with the dreary veldt. Ordered tea for six and went to gather my pals
for the feast. After I had groomed my horse, fed him, and put his <em>jhool</em>
on, we went off to the small house. But, alas! the tea was all gone. Six
other men had been there and declared that I had ordered it for them.
This is the first example of ‘slimness’ recorded to the credit or otherwise
of Lumsden’s Horse. At 4 o’clock next morning a party of us went out
on patrol duty among the surrounding hills. We had our magazines
loaded and in the dim morning light it was rather exciting work marching
silently along with the chance of meeting the enemy at any moment.
We stayed out till about 7 o’clock, having thoroughly examined the surrounding
country from the top of a high kopje, without discovering any
traces of Boers. After half an hour for breakfast, we started on the day’s
march, which it was intended would be a short one of fifteen miles; but
it rained so heavily about noon, and for an hour or two afterwards, that
on arrival at the camping-place we found it to be a mass of liquid mud
and grass, and the Major decided to keep marching on for Edenburg, about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>eight miles distant, in the hope that it would be drier there. But it continued
to pour steadily all the afternoon, and we arrived to find our camping
ground at Edenburg inches deep in water. We had no tents, so simply
wrapped ourselves in our blankets and slept where we could. Many of
us woke an hour or two afterwards, and found ourselves wet to the bone,
and in preference to trying to sleep again we made a good fire and
sat round this all night. There were a few men of one of the New Zealand
Volunteer regiments encamped here also, in charge of sick horses, and
they very kindly supplied us with hot cocoa—a most grateful and comforting
drink on such a night. They gave us very graphic descriptions of
hard times in the field. They had seen lots of fighting, being used mainly,
if not entirely, as scouts. They told us how difficult it was to find the
enemy, who kept hidden among rocks on the kopjes and never fired till
our men were within about a hundred yards. As soon as the first shot
was fired, the scouts turned and galloped for their lives, and the artillery
then began to shell the kopjes. Next morning we saw several Boer
prisoners, among them being a lad of about eighteen, who had killed
a Major in one of our regiments while coming towards him with a flag
of truce in his hand. Near the place where we had bivouacked quantities
of buried Boer ammunition and guns were discovered. We continued
our march at about 1 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and encamped in the afternoon at a small
place called Bethany. Here a night attack was expected, a Boer commando
of several thousand men being reported in the vicinity. The
men of the Maxim battery stood to their guns all night on a kopje
close by, and about thirty of us accompanied them as an extra precaution.
Cossack posts were also thrown out. Locusts, of which we had
already met several swarms on our march up, literally covered the hill-sides
here, and, getting down our backs and up our sleeves, took some
dislodging. No alarm was given, so we passed the night in peace. We
resumed our march on Good Friday, and, reaching Kaffir River in the
afternoon, encamped there for the night with Regular regiments—Guards,
Highlanders, and several others. Camps were fairly far apart, and after
picketing horses, drawing forage, and eating our frugal meals, we had
no time for exchanging visits or getting any news from the various
regiments we met at our stopping-places. However, there was consolation
for us when we received our first budget of home and Indian letters,
one of the men from A Company, then at Bloemfontein, having been
sent down with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this point the march had been across monotonous veldt, mostly
flat, treeless, and uninteresting. Here and there, where the ground held
moisture, little pink flowers of a wood sorrel showed, and nearly every mile
one came across some fresh variety of aster or daisy-like flower with
composite crown shining brightly in the coarse grass. Occasionally the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>ridges were rich with clumps of heath, scarlet, yellow, and white, but not
enough to relieve the general dreariness of distances across which one
often looked in vain for any sign of cultivation. Ant-hills and the
burrows of ant-bears were on all the veldt, and we had to wind our way
among them, following no well-defined road, but only a track, the general
direction of which was marked by a browner thread running across the
tawny veldt. Several horses blundered into the bear-holes and brought their
riders to grief, much to the general amusement. One trooper who rode
ahead waving his hand and warning those who followed by frequent cries
of ‘’Ware hole! ’Ware hole!’ suddenly disappeared, and we heard him
groan as his horse rolled over on top of him, ‘Here’s one, and I’m into
it.’ It was nearly dark then; but dead horses, mules, and dying oxen
marked the track by which other convoys had gone. We felt glad that
our transport ponies were not to share their fate. They had proved
quite useless for drawing the heavy loads in this country, so we left them
behind at Sterkstroom, sending all our baggage-carts on by train, while we
marched and bivouacked with only the blankets and supplies that could
be carried on our own horses. It was at Edenburg, I think, that after
a wet march we got leave to go into the town, hoping it might be possible
to get something better than the perpetual ‘bully beef’ and biscuits, but
the only room we could find in the only decent hotel was wanted for
officers. However, a little man of the Derby Militia came and showed us
a small Boer ‘Winkel,’ where we got excellent tea, bread, and jam. The
Derby man said he knew where he could buy some butter, which was all
we wanted to make us happy. C—— gave him 2<em>s.</em> to go and get it.
We finished our meal without that butter, and the Derby man didn’t
return. So we went back to find everything in camp wet, muddy, and
beastly. To add to our misery, a thunderstorm came on, and while we
wallowed in slush there were empty houses with roofs to them not half a
mile off. From Kaffir River we might easily have done the distance to
Bloemfontein in one march, as it was only nineteen miles; but there was
apparently no reason for hurrying, so we spent one more night in bivouac
at Kaalspruit, and on Easter Sunday, in the afternoon, marched through
Bloemfontein to our camp, which was three miles beyond. We only got a
glimpse of the town in passing through its central square and along the
main street, but, considering it was the capital of the Free State, I don’t
think any of us were very much struck with it at first sight. Colonel
Lumsden and A Company welcomed us very warmly. Our tents were
already pitched and food prepared, so we soon settled down in our new
quarters, A Company’s men receiving us as their guests and treating us
most hospitably.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>There the trooper’s narrative ends, and Colonel Lumsden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>follows with a well-deserved tribute to Major Showers and the
men of B Company, saying:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>They made a very plucky march up, the officers and men carrying
nothing but their greatcoats and blankets, and sleeping out every night
in the rain. It was too much of a trial for the ponies to pull their carts
over the hilly and heavy going; and, as I said before, this method of
transport had to be abandoned, and their carts and baggage railed up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considering the long and trying marches they had undergone, I consider
both men and horses looking wonderfully fit. A certain proportion
of them, however, were not in condition to resume immediate work.
Therefore, to replace these and in lieu of thirteen casualties on board ship
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span>, I have procured from Prince Francis of Teck, the remount
officer, twenty-six Argentine cobs, which, although not up to the standard
of our Indian mounts, are nevertheless a boon to us in the circumstances,
in a situation where horseflesh is at a premium. A certain amount
of kit and necessaries had been lost by both companies during our journey
here; but, it being our first demand on the military authorities for such,
we had no difficulty in getting our requirements satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are now (April 18) under orders to move to-morrow for Spytfontein,
five miles to the east of Karree Siding station, halting for the night
at Glen. There has been heavy rain for the past four days, and it will
be bad travelling, especially crossing the drift at Modder River. I have
been fortunate in being able to retain the whole of our transport, which
privilege has not been granted to any other unit, and shall to-morrow
be complete in every respect. The men are in keen spirits, as our post is
to be an advanced one and within range of the Boer outposts.</p>

<p class='c000'>I regret to say that Captain Beresford is no better, and will, I fear,
have to be invalided home.</p>

  <h2 id='chap07' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <span class='small'><em><span class='sc'>IMPRESSIONS OF BLOEMFONTEIN—JOIN THE 8th MOUNTED</span> <br /> INFANTRY REGIMENT ON OUTPOST</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Long streets, ill-paved and deep in mud or dust; a low stoep-shaded
cottage with vines trailing about its posts here and there
between long rows of featureless shops; a large market square
where no farm produce is displayed; a club frequented by British
officers who have little time to lounge; several churches of
the primmest Dutch type, with tall steeples that cut sharply
against the clear sky in lines uncompromisingly straight; some
public buildings, pretentious without grace or beauty; on one
side a steep hill terraced with houses of which little but the
corrugated iron roofs can be seen; on the other, roads that
straggle off to level outskirts, where villas painfully new stand
in the midst of flowerless gardens surrounded by barbed wire.
These were the first impressions of Bloemfontein gathered by
Lumsden’s Horse, and few troopers had any opportunity to modify
these impressions in more favourable circumstances afterwards.
The camp to which A Company went originally at Rietfontein
was within two miles of the town, and might have been pleasant
enough if thousands of hoofs had not cut up its turf, and the
ground had not been used as a dumping-place for rubbish which
Boer commandos could not turn to any use. Some of them
had been there before Lumsden’s Horse, and several British
regiments also. So many tens of thousands of soldiers were
camped round about the town that they may have interrupted
the currents of salubrious air which made Bloemfontein famous
in other days as a resort for invalids. There were plenty of
invalids to be seen there in the early weeks of April 1900, but
they did not regard it as the best type of sanatorium, and men
who had to sleep in small tents on the reeking ground of Rietfontein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>would not willingly go there again in search of health.
They had hardly begun to realise how serious was the stoppage
of a fresh water supply which the Boers had cut off from the
main at Modder River. Hundreds of old wells existed in the
town and its outskirts, and by opening these enough water
could be drawn for immediate wants. But, alas! the water had
been undisturbed since Bloemfontein began to draw its supply
from the distant waterworks some six or seven years earlier.
What impurities had drained into the wells during all that time
nobody knew until hospitals filled rapidly with patients suffering
from enteric and dysentery. Rietfontein was showing symptoms
of an outbreak, and so, after a week under canvas there,
Lumsden’s Horse got the welcome order to strike camp and form
a new one some three miles farther north, by Deel’s Farm, where
a clear spruit flows over its bed of white gravel between banks
that are shaded by tall eucalyptus trees and drooping sallows.</p>

<p class='c000'>After days on duty, in which they were not allowed to be
slack, troopers felt little inclination for walking the four or
five miles to Bloemfontein, which did not become more cheerful as
the number of troops increased, except for the traders, who were
rapidly getting back all they had lost by the war and a great
deal more. Officers had always the chance, whenever they
could get away from camp for an hour or two, of pleasant social
meetings at the Bloemfontein Club, where generals, regimental
commanders, and company officers from other brigades came
together for a little while at lunch or afternoon tea and exchanged
all the rumours that could be told in a few minutes—and
they were many. It was a place of strange meetings. Men
from the uttermost corners of the earth, who had perhaps not
seen each other for years, foregathered there, only to separate a
little later and go on their ways with different columns, none
knew whither. Troopers had similar experiences in the streets
and inns of Bloemfontein, where nearly every regimental badge
of the British Army and every distinguishing plume adopted by
Irregulars who had come to fight as ‘soldiers of the Queen’
were to be seen in a variety that seemed endless. Brothers
whose paths in life had parted when they left school, one going
east, another west or south, came face to face in the streets of
that little Free State town or rubbed shoulders in a motley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>crowd of khaki-clad soldiers, sometimes without recognising
each other, until accident gave them some clue. A rough word
or two of careless greeting, a tight hand-grip, a steadfast look
into eyes that remind the boys of father or mother, a light laugh
on lips that might otherwise betray too much feeling, a drink
together (if it is to be had), for ‘Auld Lang Syne,’ and then with
a jaunty ‘So long, old chap,’ they part again. It is a superstition,
or at any rate a recognised custom, not to say ‘Good-bye’
in such circumstances. But if men only thought of its literal
meaning, what better wish could there be? Yet, for all its stir
and bustle and dramatic incidents, Bloemfontein was a dull
place in those days for any man who entered it and found no
intimate friends there to greet him. Comrades they all were,
but in a rough-and-ready sort of comradeship that needed the
fire of the battlefield to try it and perchance anneal it into something
stronger than the ties of mere kinship. But this is a
thing which only soldiers understand, and seldom even they.
Lumsden’s Horse knew it not then, but for some of them the secret
was to be disclosed before many days had passed, and in a form that
will never fade from their memory. Meanwhile, they went about
their duties methodically enough in camp or took their pleasures
sadly in streets where thousands of soldiers wandered daily,
finding no entertainment, no place of resort except dingy bars,
where liquors of more than alcoholic potency were sold, and very
little change from campaign fare except at a price that made
even the necessaries of life prohibited luxuries for a man who had
no more than his shilling a day to spend. One of Lumsden’s
Horse who was sent into Bloemfontein on orderly duty gives a
vivid sketch of all this in a few touches that are the more
graphic because they only pretend to note passing impressions.
Writing a day after B Company’s arrival at Deel’s Farm, he
shows how the men had to rub their horses down while standing
inches deep in mud. So much rain was out of season, but
South Africa is, like other places, occasionally fickle in this
respect. To troopers it did not seem an ideal way of spending
Easter Monday, and the whistle, of which officers made free
use, must have been irritating to nerves already overstrained, for
it is never mentioned without a forcible prefix. However, when
rain ceased and sunshine appeared for an hour in the afternoon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>these men were merry enough at a game of cricket,
which, by violating all the higher rules, must have reminded
them of similar sports in England when they were boys and
welcomed Easter Monday as the day of all others appropriate
to cricket. The next morning a great cheer rolled from camp
to camp, and Lumsden’s Horse, responding lustily, passed it on
to the next without asking what the unusual excitement meant.
When they heard afterwards that troops were cheering because
‘Kruger had surrendered,’ a strange depression took hold of them.
At that moment all the discomforts and drudgery of a soldier’s
life were forgotten in the humiliating thought that the corps
would have to go back to India without a chance of proving
itself in battle. It turned out, however, to be all mere rumour,
though not so baseless as some of which Lumsden’s Horse had
after-experience. The Transvaal President’s offer to negotiate
for peace on terms all in his own favour must have been known
in England then, and in some mysterious way a reflex of it came
to camps on the veldt, where troops, who had seen plenty of
the fighting that Lumsden’s Horse were eager for, welcomed
the illusive tidings with a cheer. In its train, however, came
something nearly as good—a post bringing letters from ‘England,
home, and beauty,’ and for one non-commissioned officer at least
‘a parcel full of excellent things.’ Before he had time to enjoy
these he was under orders for Bloemfontein, and after a ride
through pouring rain he got there in time to hear another
disconcerting rumour, and to find some of his comrades selling
their kit because ‘they had been ordered back.’ Wisely resolving
not to act on anything but definite orders, and, taking the advice
of a corporal in the City Imperial Volunteers, who persuaded him
‘to sit tight,’ he waited, making the best of circumstances that
were by no means bright according to his own brief record, which
runs, ‘No dinner to be had at the station. Got tea sixpence a
cup, bread and jam sixpence.’ Hungry and dispirited, he turned
in and went to bed at the station, which means something very
different from the untravelled civilian’s idea of a bed. Then
next morning ‘bought a bob’s worth of oat straw for horse—groomed
and fed him. Put my wet things out to dry, and
sallied forth to the station. Had an excellent breakfast: porridge,
haddock, chops, and two cups of coffee, for three shillings. Went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to the hospital to try and get my leg dressed, but couldn’t find
anybody to speak to. Thence to a most pleasant chemist—a
Dutchman. Went to the station for lunch—another three bob.’
Not a profitable day’s work for a corporal on Cavalry pay without
‘colonial allowances.’ After that came tea and dinner, so that
he was evidently doing his best to prove the wisdom of Mark
Tapley’s philosophy. Having found circumstances in which it was
a credit to be jolly, he made the most of them. It is not every
soldier, however, who, having indulged in a little extravagance
of that kind, could write, ‘Afterwards to the bank, and had an
agreeable interview with the manager’; nor every man, with a
balance to his credit, who would have turned cheerfully again
towards the rough life of a camp and the unknown hardships
that were to follow. When orders came next day for all Lumsden’s
Horse to rejoin their corps in readiness for an immediate advance,
this non-commissioned officer paid another visit to his friend
the chemist and asked how much he owed. ‘The chemist
refused to take anything. Pretty good that for a Dutchman
and evidently a pro-Boer.’ With that pleasant experience
blotting out all unfavourable impressions of Bloemfontein, the
corporal rode back to camp at Deel’s Farm to find all the tents
being struck.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they had to spend a miserable night by the bivouac fire
and get what amusement they could out of good stories. One,
suggested perhaps by talk of chemists and surgical operations,
is worthy to be preserved. To appreciate the point of the
joke you must know that a lieutenant-general’s badges of rank
are a sword and bâton crossed, with the crown above them.
A man of the —— Yeomanry, then quartered in Bloemfontein,
was suffering agonies from toothache, and, like our friend the
corporal, had searched every hospital in vain for a surgeon who
might have leisure to extract it. As he crossed the Market
Square, a general of division whose kindness of heart is as
notorious as his strength of language, was coming out of the
Club. To him the yeoman advanced, and, after a hesitating
preface, asked the General whether he would mind drawing a
tooth. For a moment the General was dumbfounded, but then
his powers of expression came back to him. ‘What the devil
do you mean?’ he roared, thinking the yeoman was unpardonably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>familiar. The man’s face fell. ‘I’m very sorry, sir,’ he said,
‘but our doctor’s on leave, and——’ ‘But,’ said the officer,
smiling at the man’s mistake, ‘I’m not a doctor; I’m General
——’ The yeoman stammered, ‘But—but—your badge, sir!’
The General good-humouredly turned his shoulder to the abashed
trooper. ‘Here you are, my lad; what’s the matter with the
badge? “Crossed swords, bâton, and crown.”’ ‘Good heavens!’
said the man, ‘I hope you’ll forgive me, sir. I thought it was
the skull and cross-bones!’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Before daybreak in the morning of April 21, Lumsden’s
Horse were roused to pack kits and saddle up for their march.
Impartial observers said they were very smart about it, but a
story went round that the Colonel had expressed himself as
much disappointed with B Company, saying that the others
would have saddled up and walked round them three times.
This was apparently only a playful invention, but it so angered
one trooper that he could only express his feelings in choice
Hindustani. He was mollified afterwards on learning that A
Company had really admired the soldierly way in which B
Company got ready, and then he excused his strong language by
writing, ‘I understand now the expression “Swear like a trooper.”
We hear and do more of it every day.‘ It was a painful confession
for one of Lumsden’s Horse to make, but the incident, apparently
trivial, shows that a wholesome spirit of emulation in deeds was
animating the men, and that would always be regarded by
soldiers as ample atonement for unnecessary rivalry in linguistic
attainments. The time was close at hand, too, when Lumsden’s
Horse would have more serious things to think about than these.
Yet nobody knows better than old campaigners how little things
occupy the thoughts of men even when they are doing great
deeds. No opportunity for achieving greatness came to the
corps during its first day’s march through a country where the
enemy’s appearance might be looked for at any moment, but in
another way the men showed their fitness for a soldier’s work—by
helping the transport out of difficulties. It was in crossing a
drift at the Little Modder River that carts stuck with wheels
jammed tightly in deep holes between slippery boulders, and
teams floundered in fruitless attempts to recover their footing.
The Editor, having been in one of those holes, horse and all, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>reason to remember the place and the swirl of water where it
rashes over rocky ledges into a deeper pool. By dint of manful
work, Lumsden’s Horse got their carts clear of the drift, only to
find them axle deep in the treacherous soil of a neighbouring
vlei some minutes later. Then ammunition had to be taken out
and carried to firm ground and carts lifted bodily out of the mire.
It was an experience by which the transport drivers learned not to
trust appearances and to beware of grass that looked unusually
green. Still, as Sergeant Stephens, of the Transport, wrote in
relating his experiences, ‘If anything ever frightened our drivers
it was the word “drift”; you should have seen the worried looks
when they heard there was a drift ahead.’ That night the corps
bivouacked beyond Glen, where General Tucker’s division had
been in touch with the enemy for nearly a month and warding off
frequent attempts to interfere with Engineers who were hard at
work on a ‘deviation’ near the ruined railway bridge. There they
had to bivouac with nothing but blankets to protect them from the
bitterly cold wind, and they went to sleep supperless because the
transport, delayed by many causes, had not come up. No alarms
or excursions disturbed their rest that night, but their march next
morning was to the accompaniment of distant pom-poms and
heavier guns and the sounds of fighting not far off. They did not
know the meaning of it all then. It seemed to them but a local
skirmish, and not the penultimate phase of a great movement in
which Ian Hamilton, French, and Rundle had been sweeping the
Boers before them from Wepener to Thaba ’Nchu and thence
eastward and northward, clearing the country for a still greater
movement. No shots came near the marching column. The
screen of outposts holding inquisitive Boers in check was miles
away from the drift where Lumsden’s Horse crossed the main
Modder River, and, for all they could see, it might have been still
miles off when they marched up a steep track and bivouacked on
the pleasant hillside, relieving some New South Wales Mounted
Rifles, whose horses had been used up by incessant patrolling.
They were, however, in the outpost line there as part of the 8th
Mounted Infantry, commanded by Colonel Ross, to whom Colonel
Lumsden reported himself that afternoon. Some officers of
Regular regiments whose pickets were near at hand came to
have a look at these Indian Volunteers, who were quite gratified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>afterwards to hear that the Colonel of the Norfolks thought them
‘a very fine set of men, but undisciplined.’ It was true enough
they had not much discipline of the parade-ground type, but
they were held together by bonds stronger than any rules or
regulations can weld, and inspired by a sentiment that would
have made them ‘play the game’ wherever fortune might place
them. And part of that game was for them to be soldiers in
deed as well as in spirit, though they might lack the mere outward
show of subordination. Spytfontein, which formed the
centre of a position held by Lumsden’s Horse, is an outwork of
the rugged range that sweeps from east to west in an irregular
curve just north of Karree Siding, and from which General
Tucker’s division, aided by a turning movement of Cavalry and
Mounted Infantry under General French, dislodged the Boers a
month earlier. Though they had made several attempts to
reoccupy that range in the hope of being able to shell us out of
Glen, they lost ground each time, and finally retired to an
entrenched position in front of Brandfort, to which Spytfontein
was our nearest approach. Trooper Burn-Murdoch in one of his
clever letters to the ‘Englishman’ gave an admirable sketch of
outpost work when it was a new experience to Lumsden’s Horse:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Spytfontein consists of several kopjes with rocks between and, so far
as I could see, only one farmhouse, so you will not find it marked on the
map. We took the place of some Australians, as they had been pretty
busy and their horses were all knocked up. To the north of us were
Loch’s Horse about 500 yards off, and quite close to our southern flank
were some companies of East Lancashire Mounted Infantry. What with
outlying pickets, guards, horse pickets, and such like, we did not find
time hang heavy on our hands. And, as our nearest neighbours over the
kopjes were large bodies of Boers with heavy guns and other arms, we
had, as the saying is, to sleep with one eye open, and that one well
skinned. I have many a time steered my way by Old Crux away down
south. But I found that gazing at it over the icy-cold muzzle of a Lee-Metford
was, though possibly just as profitable and useful a job, very
much less romantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>One reads in Olive Schreiner and in other African authors’ books of
the never-to-be-forgotten pleasure of sleeping out on the great South
African veldt, the pale calm moon overhead, and only the shade of the
waggon for covering, around which the trek oxen rest after their day’s
toil, the monotonous crunch, crunch of their jaws as they chew the cud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>being the only sound that breaks the awe-inspiring silence. My personal
experience was vile—cold winds, little or no moon, wet grass and rocks to
lie upon, soaking wet feet and clothes, one wet blanket and ditto coat, the
only change to this being two hours’ sentry-go every four hours.</p>

<p>OUTLYING PICKET TAKING UP POSITION<br /><span class='small'>(<em>From a sketch by J.S. Cowen</em>)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We were not allowed to walk about as on ordinary sentry-go, but had
to keep quiet and sit or lie down for the most of the time, with our eyes
straining out into the dark north, where every piece of scrub or large stone
rapidly grew into a slouch-hatted Boer, as our brains became hypnotised
with ceaseless gazing. And on our keen sense of hearing and sight
depended the lives of all the corps!</p>

<p class='c000'>One afternoon the alarm was given, and we promptly ‘stood to arms’
in excited expectation of an attack. But it proved to be a false alarm;
and I was not surprised that it was so, as our valiant signaller standing
on the sky-line of a neighbouring kopje flagged the news down to us, and
of course all the Boers between our pickets and Kroonstad at once knew
that Lumsden’s Horse were awake <em>and there</em>—so they thought better of
it. Some few days afterwards we got orders to parade at 2.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to
take part in an attack on a Boer force which had been ‘located’ on some
hills to the south-west of us and skirting the Modder River. I was horse
sentry that night, so got practically no sleep. At 2.30, however, amid a
thundercloud of English and Hindustani, Lumsden’s Horse awoke and
managed to saddle up in the darkness; and then, by dint of shouting out
each other’s names, we managed to wriggle into our proper subsections.
As one man put it, ‘the bundabust was shocking.’</p>

<p class='c000'>From the midst of this noisy dark chaos emerging, away we marched.
Bitterly cold and cheerless was that morning, every second man’s teeth
chattering like so many castanets, while one’s feet felt <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span> with the
stirrup irons. In a short time we were joined by Loch’s Horse, the
Victorian Mounted Rifles, the Artillery, and Lancashire Mounted Infantry,
and silence was the strict order of the march; and silence it was pretty
well, until one of Loch’s Horse, with his cut-off open, let bang two shots—phew!
phew! went the two nickels over the lot of us, and half of us
‘bowed our heads’ reverently. I believe Mr. Loch got fourteen days’ for
that, and served him jolly well right.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun coming out, our spirits rose somewhat, and our fingers became
warm enough to pull out bits of biscuit from our haversacks and so have
a sumptuous breakfast on horseback. An hour and a half’s march brought
us to a deep creek with a good drift over it, and this we crossed in safety.
On the other side we found a long and broad expanse of plain gradually
sloping up to a ridge of high kopjes some four miles in front of us. On
these kopjes our friends the Boers were supposed to be waiting for us, so
we spread out into extended single ranks with about eleven yards interval.
A kind friend having given me a cheroot, I lit up and enjoyed a peaceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>smoke, while at the same time I could not help wondering how many more
smokes the Boers would allow me to have. Shortly afterwards we got
the order to advance at the canter, which we did; as our scouts were
barely 1,500 yards ahead and had not had time to ‘search’ the kopjes
properly, this was, in my opinion, a risky order. However, we got there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Firing had meanwhile commenced on our left, and two of our
Victorian scouts were bagged. Our pom-poms and guns then tuned up;
boom! pom-pom-pom, pom-pom! boom—and after a little of this double-bass
tune the Boers bolted and left us in possession. Skirting along the
scrub-covered banks of the Modder River, we at length reached Waggon
Bridge, over which my subsection took the lead as scouts; and about
midday arrived at a Boer farm some two and a half miles further on.
Here we stayed the night, camping out on some commanding kopjes. A
strict watch was, of course, kept up all night. Next day we duly received
some nice compliments from the General in command on our rapid march
and successful capture of Waggon Bridge; and then, like the celebrated
Duke of York’s Army, we marched back again to our camp.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>An officer of the corps, writing to friends at Calcutta, adds
some interesting details:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We are right up at the front now holding a line of kopjes overlooking
a large plain all round. There is nothing in the plain except one or two
small kopjes occupied by the Boers between here and Brandfort. They
come close in every night, and often do a little sniping at our outposts,
but they disappear at daybreak. The other morning four Australians
went out to a farm about three miles off; there were supposed to be only
women there, and they had a couple of white flags up; but as soon as
the first man got into the yard several Boers jumped out of the pigsty,
shot his horse, wounded him and took him prisoner—the others had to
clear. They say about a dozen Boers come there every night. The
Australians have a picket a mile off, but they have not succeeded in
catching anybody. The General won’t allow firing into the farm, because
he says the women can’t help the Boers coming for supplies and things.
The farm where we get our milk and stuff is owned by a Boer who has
given up his arms; he fought against us, and bucks that he shot a Gordon
Highlander officer at ten paces at Magersfontein. This Boer was in an
awful funk lest his old friends should reach his farm and shoot him; at
least, he said so. The night before last our sentries on one of the pickets
were quite certain they saw our Boer friend lamp-signalling, and our
signallers on the kopje noticed it also. Twenty Boers were seen in the
distance in the afternoon, and he was evidently signalling to them.
To-day there was a quantity of ammunition found in one of his kraals,
so he will probably find himself in chokee. The day before I rejoined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>from hospital we attacked, or, rather, the Boers attacked us, but were
shelled out of their position. Two of our officers who were left in camp
saw from one kopje a shell burst in the middle of five men, and saw
them all go down.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 23rd, when our men were sent away to the right with some
other M.I. and the Cheshires to seize a bridge and to drive Boer raiders
from some kopjes, they did not apparently wait to be turned out, but
cleared and trekked across the plain to Brandfort. Our men never fired a
shot, though Loch’s Horse on their left had a little shooting and lost one
man, an advance scout. The Boers let him walk right into their midst,
and as he turned round to bolt his horse came down and they took him
prisoner. Our position is about, as far as I can make out, the centre of a
half circle from Karree Siding to the Glen. One quarter circle is held by the
7th Division, two batteries, and various M.I. The other afternoon some
Boers started sniping at our signal-post, but came nowhere near hitting; we
all stood to arms, and when thirty men were sent out they cleared. They
generally amuse themselves sniping at our outposts at something like
2,000 yards with no effect. We have to furnish three night pickets—three
officers, five non-commissioned, and sixty men every night; it falls
rather hard on the section officers, as one is sick, and the company commanders
and the staff, of course, don’t do it, so it means three of the
seven are out every night. There is not very much to do on picket
except post the sentries, visit them two or three times in the night, and
get them in again a little before sunrise, when they return to camp. There
is also a day outpost of twenty men and two non-commissioned officers,
and generally a convoy of similar size into Karree Siding; so the men,
too, have enough to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a fight expected to-day (29th), but it has not come off,
only a few shots on our left. The order has just come for us to go out
to-morrow, leaving a sufficient guard to strike our tents and bring them on
if necessary. We hope it is the real advance this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Douglas Jones proved himself such an excellent Assistant-Quartermaster
that, as B Company’s appointments were all probationary, he
has been made Company Quartermaster-Sergeant. We lost poor old
Roger at Kruger Siding on the way up. He had quite turned into a
regimental dog, and on the march used generally to come along with
the rearguard. We halted to feed there one march, and he may have
stopped with the Royal Scots. It is quite possible he went back to
Jagersfontein, and made up to the Gloucester Yeomanry. They are
bringing in two of our lame horses, so if he did we may get him again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another correspondent who was kept in camp by a slight
ailment while his comrades were away on patrol or some more
exciting expedition records how he got out kits and collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>firewood, ‘a thing I never did before,’ and how when others
of his section came back they lay by the dying embers to
keep themselves warm and occasionally made the fire flicker
up by throwing more wood on it, reckless of danger from snipers,
who were always on the prowl. While the main body of
Lumsden’s Horse were away on that dash for Waggon Bridge the
Boers made a counter demonstration from Brandfort, supported
by pom-poms, and got within a thousand yards of the Red
House Farm, but did no damage beyond interfering with the
domestic arrangements of a
Regular regiment, whose officers,
being too far from the point
of attack to see what really
happened, thought their position
was being seriously threatened
and wanted 28,000 rounds of
ammunition brought up from
Karree Siding for emergencies.
The orderly corporal who sent
that request on got jeered at as
an alarmist, when nothing happened
except a retirement of
the Boers. The next day Lee
Stewart, who had been left behind
in hospital at Cape Town,
rejoined, and got a cordial welcome
from all his comrades
when they marched back from
their first little expedition. The
section mess was enabled to
regale him at dinner that night on ‘chicken cooked by N——
and beefsteaks,’ so that one hardly wonders to find in the next
day’s record the melancholy note, ‘There little was to eat; sat
round the cook-house—two tins on the open veldt—and talked.’</p>

<p class='c000'>In his official report Colonel Lumsden sums up all this in a
few brief sentences, having matters of more serious weight on
his mind at the moment:</p>

Brigade, our object being to protect a bridge about eight miles distant
on the main road to Bloemfontein, which the Boers intended to destroy.
We were only just in time to prevent them carrying out their object,
by getting there before them, with only a couple of casualties among the
Australian contingent. We spent the night at the bridge, returning the
next day to Spytfontein. While at the latter place we were fortunate in
securing a few more Government remounts to replace several unfit horses.
I may mention that at Spytfontein we were in easy sight of the Boer
outposts, being only eight miles distant from Brandfort. A long flat
plain separated the Boer boundary from our own, and their scouts were
distinctly visible to us every morning. Nothing eventful occurred during
the next few days, but on the 30th we received our baptism of fire as far
as we are personally concerned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>How often ignorant critics have sneered at that phrase ‘the
baptism of fire,’ which expresses finely, with literary completeness
and force, a truth of which men who have never been in the
front line of battle can know nothing! However much the
phrase may have been degraded by melodramatic application,
it is a gem in its clearness of thought and perfection of finish.
The soldier’s first fight is a plunge from which he emerges a new
being. Whether the change may be for better or worse depends
probably on temperament and previous associations. The fire
of battle does not purify a sinner or sear the soul of a saint, but
neither is quite the same after as he was before passing through
it. He has seen things which, in some subtle way, unfelt, perhaps,
and certainly unacknowledged, will influence the remaining
years of his life. It is not only because he has looked death in
the face—that is a common enough experience elsewhere and
leaves no perceptible trace—but he has stood where dear comrades
fell beside him in the midst of scenes that at other times would
be heartrending, and, as if in a state of complete detachment
from himself, he has passed callous through it all. The braver
a man is, the more surely some consciousness of that strange state
clings to him. To call it selfish indifference or the numbness
of fear, as some insolent ignoramus might, would be to falsify the
history of war. Selfish men and cowards do not walk with eyes
open into the very jaws of death to help a wounded comrade,
nor would dazed brains be capable of the swift thought that
characterises soldiers in the direst danger. Yet men who at
such times have done deeds worthy of the Cross for Valour will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>[Blank Page]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>not be able to tell you what sensations possessed them, simply
because feeling in the ordinary sense was for a moment, or for an
hour it may be, dead. The mental faculties were clear enough—so
clear, indeed, that they took impressions, photographic in
sharpness and detail, of every immediate surrounding, yet with
no power of communicating those impressions in any sentient
form. They knew, but did not feel. There are people who will
tell you gravely that the Victoria Cross is an evil because it
inspires men to do reckless things out of sheer desire for the
glory of that decoration. It is all nonsense. I have known a
great many Victoria Cross heroes, but not one who gained that
high distinction because he tried to or was conscious at the
moment of deserving it. There are soldiers of some countries
in the world to whom glory and the lust of fame are incentives
to valorous deeds. They love to think that the eyes of the world,
and especially of its fairer half, are on them as they march to
battle, and for the sake of these things they will volunteer to
lead forlorn hopes; but once in the fight they behave as Nature
or Fate decrees. The mere outward trappings of gallantry avail
nothing then.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the curious duality that can only be described as detachment
of mind from body, memory recalls two conspicuous
examples which occurred within my knowledge, if not both
within my actual range of vision, on the battlefield of Elandslaagte.
One was when the Imperial Light Horse were rushing
up the last slope to that wonderful rallying cry of theirs in an
onslaught that rolled like a resistless wave across the shot-torn
crest and crowned the day with victory. One trooper dropped
out of the ranks as if a bullet had struck him, yet he knew that
only his legs had given way, suddenly refusing to carry him any
further. Speaking frankly of this incident afterwards, he said
that at the moment no thought in his mind was so strong as the
desire to be with those who were charging up the stony heights,
waved on by their intrepid Colonel, Chisholm. He had no
sensation that could be akin to fear, and yet he was powerless to
move a limb. Then suddenly a strange thing happened. A
Mauser bullet ploughed along his cheek and stung him. In
another moment mind and body were leaping together up that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>hill, each striving to be first in the race, and behaving with a
gallantry at which even brave men wondered. But for that
accidental shot the trooper might have stopped where he fell
and been branded as a coward. The other illustration occurred
almost simultaneously, but in a different way. Some wounded
men of the same dauntless corps were lying on an opposite slope
exposed to a heavy fire from some Boers who had crept back
to a rocky ledge from which they were raking the whole of that
ground with a shower of nickel. John Stuart, of the ‘Morning
Post,’ and I went to help two or three who were too badly hit to
move, and succeeded in getting them from the bare veldt to
comparative safety behind small boulders. One of them told me
afterwards that his mind was full of nothing but profound
gratitude and admiration when he saw us tucking a comrade
into one little sheltered nook, and yet the words that his tongue
all the while hurled at us for our folly in not taking cover were
quite unfit for publication. No man can pass through experiences
of that kind and be in all things the same again. The
‘baptism of fire’ has changed him, though he may never admit it
to himself or betray it to his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the time was at hand when Lumsden’s Horse were to
take their plunge and emerge from it with the reputation of soldiers
in whom trust could be placed from that day forward. The
share they had in operations that extended over a front of nearly
thirty miles, from Thaba ’Nchu to Ospruit, was comparatively
small. But for them it was the most eventful episode of the
campaign—their first fight, their passing of the threshold beyond
which was the secret of more of human life than they had ever
known. In that one day they were to look death in the face, to
see comrades, the friends of their youth, fall beside them, to
have thoughts of sorrow in their minds but no pang in their
hearts. Grief was to come days, perhaps months afterwards,
when a chance word or the touch of a hand might set the pent-up
currents flowing in channels that war had closed. Above all,
they were to know the British soldier as he is in fight—a
creature of strange impulses, of wonderful tenderness, when he
might be expected to show the roughest qualities with which
habit has endowed him, and of sublime endurance. Writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>after the plunge, one of Lumsden’s Horse thanks God that he
had seen it all:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>For such is the British Tommy—taken from the lowest classes, so
our sixth-class paper editors take care to blazen forth. Drunken louts
in the streets, not allowed into a decent theatre, knocked about if
a bit drunk by an officious policeman—everything that is bad, in
fact. Change the scene, and what do we see? Mile after mile of ‘the
thin red line,’ now changed to ‘the dirty khaki rag’; the battered
khaki helmet, Tommy’s only pillow at night; the coarse, hard ammunition
boots. Dirt and vermin cover him from head to foot—no water to
drink, much less to wash with—a heavy marching kit, rifle, and cartridges,
and as for food, why, not enough to feed a dog. Ay! Many and many
are the dogs that would have refused Tommy’s South African <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>menu</em></span> with
turned-up noses. Overhead at times a scorching sun; at others a blinding,
cold, blustering rain; and at night always the bleak, cold, north-west wind.
March! March! March! On they go, bravely, truly, sturdily, hardly
a grumble, while safely at home you have your collar-and-tie renegade
telling us of the atrocities these brave men are committing. Lies! all
lies, I say. I’ve met some of those people since I came back, and my
one wish has been to have them out against a brick wall with six good
brave Tommies to fire a volley. Yes. I am glad, ay, more than glad,
spite of wounds and hardships, that I have seen our good brothers of the
khaki as they ought to be seen—no swell uniforms there, no pipeclay, no
shining cuirasses and polished helmets to ‘catch on’ with a non-military
public. Ye gods, no! all khaki, khaki; all one great army, be it a
Colonial, be it a London slum, or a Highland bracken born lot of men.
They are all brothers in arms, one in object, one in deeds of bravery and
devotion to an Empire.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>That eloquent passage, written by Trooper Burn-Murdoch,
gentleman and tea-planter, should be enough to silence the
tongue of calumny and convince any unprejudiced mind that
whatever war may do it does not brutalise. In illustration of
that truth many other instances will have to be given before this
narrative runs its course to an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, however, it is necessary to describe briefly the general
scope of operations whereby Lumsden’s Horse were drawn, much
sooner than they had any hope of, into their first fight.
Attempts had been made by Generals Rundle, Ian Hamilton,
and French to surround Boer forces that were retiring sullenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>from their futile siege of Wepener. But De Wet was in
command there, and his mobile ‘slimness,’ aided by secret
information from Free State burghers, who, having taken the oath
of neutrality, were allowed to live on their farms or to move about
freely without any watch being kept on them, frustrated every
attempt to hem in the commandos. General Brabant’s Colonial
division, following Sir Leslie Rundle’s, was still some distance
off, and General Pole-Carew’s retirement to Bloemfontein for
fresh orders at this juncture unfortunately left a gap open between
General French’s left and the force under Sir Ian Hamilton, which
was by that time extended along the Modder valley near Sanna’s
Post, facing north-east. Through this opening the Boers slipped
back to the high ground round about Thaba ’Nchu. Pressed hard
by French, they were driven from the southern and western spurs
of these hills, but still clung to the commanding mountain itself,
where they gathered reinforcements day by day. Then French
ceased to press, and the turn came for Ian Hamilton to strike, in
the hope that he might drive a wedge across the lower ridges
between Thaba ’Nchu and Brandfort, which would not only tear
the chain of Boer positions asunder, but also open the way for a
combined movement by which their left wing, under De Wet,
should be enveloped if he attempted to prolong his stand in the
Thaba ’Nchu range. It was cleverly designed; but we all know
what often happens with the best-laid plans, especially when
there are spies free to move about without danger to themselves.
It was at this phase of the extended operations that Sir Ian
Hamilton began to advance towards Houtnek, where he found
himself confronted by a formidable gathering of commandos
under General Louis Botha, and they were being reinforced from
all directions, the Boers having regained hope and courage from
the presence of a leader whose reputation then stood incomparably
high among them. Though the numerical strength and
boldness of his enemies were something of a surprise to General
Hamilton, he had in some measure prepared for the unforeseen by
calling upon General Tucker to make a diversion by which
the Boers under De la Rey’s command in Brandfort might be
discouraged from sending reinforcements to Houtnek. With the
Seventh Division, or rather in advance of it as a covering screen,
the Mounted Infantry brigade under Colonel Henry was ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to co-operate, supported by General Maxwell’s brigade of Infantry.
Of the Mounted Infantry, to which a post of honour was thus
assigned, the 8th Battalion, commanded by Colonel Ross, was to
form the advance guard. Thus Lumsden’s Horse were destined in
their first fight to bear the brunt of the attack if it should come;
and, in high spirits at the prospect, they looked with an interest
they had never felt before towards the rugged line of low kopjes
far away across the broad plain with light from the setting sun
full upon them. That the orders were thus made known to all
ranks twelve hours before they could be acted on is a proof that
they had not been drawn up on the spur of sudden emergency,
and, indeed, Sir Ian Hamilton was only then feeling for his enemy
in the direction of Houtnek. At this point the picturesque pen
of the ‘Englishman’s’ correspondent goes on with the narrative:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On April 29 we got warning to be ready to take part in a general
attack early the next morning. So we bustled round and got everything
ready. At 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> I and two other men of my sub-section were ordered
out on outlying picket, leaving Trooper Thelwall to saddle our three
horses before daybreak as well as his own, when we were to march into
camp again and get mounted and ready to start with the rest. So, just
having time to get half a pint of tea and some dry bread, we hurried out
on picket for the night. And that was, practically speaking, the last food
I tasted until 8 o’clock the next night. Not what you could call ‘’igh
livin’,’ is it? It was bitterly cold, and, what with the everlasting night
wind and only one blanket, we pickets were not much troubled with sleep
that night. However, at 5 o’clock in the morning of the 30th we rolled
up our blankets and marched into camp, and at once set to work at
tightening up girths, adjusting saddles and kits. I had just time to put
some bread into my haversack, and half fill my horse’s nosebag with
cartridges and also two or three priceless ‘smokes,’ when we had to
mount. So away went all chances of breakfast that morning. Alas!
some of us had no need for food and drink in the evening. Just as old
Sol began to rise up over the kopjes we marched out of camp, up over
the ridge, and down the other side towards the open veldt. Here we
paused for a while to allow the other troops to join us. Taking advantage
of this short halt, we got into our proper sub-sections, dismounted,
and had a last look at our girths, and tightened up curbs, &amp;c. Poor old
mokes! How many of them, my own included, were fated never to see
another day dawn! Colonel Lumsden now rode up to us and gave us a
rough idea of what we were to do, and informed us that our B Troop was
to have the place of honour, and that we were to take the lead. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>knowing us as he did, he had not the slightest doubt that we would
not fail to distinguish ourselves, &amp;c. To which our gallant ‘Oirish’
Captain Chamney began to reply in his usual Indian after-dinner style,
that he felt proud of his troop, and fully conscious of the great honour
that was bestowed upon us in being allowed to take the lead; and he
sincerely hoped that we would do justice to the confidence bestowed on us.
He would no doubt have continued in this style for some time had not
our good old Major chipped in with his usual ‘down-in-his-boots’ aside:
‘Oh, that’s all right, Chamney; damn it, man, of course you will.’ And
these were the last words I ever heard the good old man utter in this life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Good old Showers, gruff as
they make ’em, but a true white
man’s heart inside for all that.
Never afraid to jump on an officer
for all you were worth if you
thought he deserved it; and after
those long hot Indian parades,
how many times have we heard
your hearty laugh at the head of
the camp mess-table! For seven
years our Colonel, and the man
who made the Surma Valley
Light Horse second to none in
India.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the attacking forces being
now mustered, we made a start
and away we marched. For
some part of the time our route
lay alongside a pretty little lagoon,
and then the road gradually lost
itself in the great open veldt.
How peaceful it all seemed that
morning! The few cattle and sheep that were quietly grazing here
and there on the scanty tussocks would casually lift up their heads and
gaze at us, and, seeing that there were no strange dogs with us, would go
on cropping the grass, though possibly a sheep or two would scuttle out
of the way with a contemptuous wriggle of their tails. Time of war!
one says—humbug! one could not believe it on that quiet morning. The
fresh ozonised air, the soft, steady breeze, now pleasantly tempered by
the bright morning sun; and there, by the doorway of the quiet little
farmhouse, the farmer’s wife standing with her milk-pails all ready, while
she laughingly makes passing remarks to her departing ‘guests.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The only signs of war, maybe, are those few fences with their wires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>cut down; and these you would suppose had been broken down by some
restless calves or light-hearted foal. From our ranks could be seen and
smelt the little clouds of tobacco-smoke which rose up in the clear air like
so many stray wandering bits of cumulus clouds, while back in the rear
could be heard the quaintly sad airs of ‘Bearer Ganga Dīn’ and ‘Who’s
dat a-callin’?’ as some of our musically inclined troopers gave vent unconsciously
to their feelings. What a lovely, jolly morning that was!
All those dire hardships, cold, hunger, and wet, we had known only too
well; but to-day—light, warmth, and the indescribable freshness of the
open veldt, while under us were our plucky Indians, Arabs, and Walers,
fresh as English daisies and keen as the air we breathed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some miles ahead of us—though seemingly quite close, owing to the
intensely clear atmosphere—lay a long range of low-lying hills all lighted
up with various shades of colouring, the hues of which kept ever changing
from moment to moment as the sun rose higher in the heavens. Still
further on, and filling up the whole background of this typically African
landscape, lay the razor-backs and table-topped peaks of the Basuto hills,
from the tops of which soft filmy wisps of cloud drifted silently away into
that great blue ‘nothingness.’ All peace! Peace on earth, it seemed to
us that fair morn. Nor could we poor troopers realise that ere God’s
life-giving sun should set that night great Mars would look down on
many of us poor mortals writhing in the agonies of cruel death-dealing
wounds and the tortures of the surgeon’s knife and probe, while some
poor souls, like these vanishing vapoury clouds, would have left this little
world for the infinite beyond. Nor could the mind of our well-loved
Major, as he rode at the head of those men he had known for long, long
years, have realised that in a few short hours his true British heart would
have ceased to beat, and his life’s blood would be mingled with the dust
of that great continent where so many good men and true had already
given up their lives for an Empire’s cause. Thank God for the impenetrable
veil that He casts over our future! One scene especially
struck me by its beauty, and that was when a battery of Artillery toiled
over a tussocky ridge right into the blazing disc of the sun. As gun after
gun topped the ridge the whole team, horses and men, were shut out from
our sight by the powerful blaze of light in a most curious way; while here
and there a khaki-clad helmeted Artilleryman stood silhouetted against
the sky-line, over which the khaki gun-carriages disappeared into a
glaring sea of gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we were now approaching some suspicious-looking kopjes, we
opened out into extended order as usual, and Lumsden’s Horse were told
off to take, and <em>hold</em>, a certain line of kopjes some two miles off. So we
promptly set to work, approaching them very ‘cannily,’ with scouts well
out in advance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Arriving at the base of the kopjes without opposition, we dismounted
and skirmished up to the tops, but found that the Boers had cleared out,
though, judging by the several ‘sangars’ built of rocks, these must have
been held in force. Our scouts in the meantime had advanced along the
plain on the other side of the kopjes, and just as we arrived on top the
enemy opened on them with a continuous rattle of rifle fire, and I saw
several of the poor beggars limping back over the plain pulling their
wounded horses after them, while all around them, to use whaler’s
language, the sandy plain kept ‘spouting’ as the deadly bullets struck
and ricocheted. From where we were it was utterly impossible to tell
from what direction the bullets were coming, so we could do little in the
way of keeping down the Boer fire. However, we did our best. But as
the enemy soon ceased firing we reserved our ammunition for later use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away to our left the Artillery were now having a great duel, while the
pom-poms on both sides were making things generally cruel for the
Mounted Infantry, and also for those who were holding their horses.
Pom-pom-pom! pom-pom! and immediately whack, whack, whack!
would echo the vile bursting shells. Then boo-m-m came the big hidden
Creusot—and oh, the sound of its messenger, wo-o-o-o-ough! It would
come soaring up with a dreadfully mournful sound, while the whole
atmosphere seemed to vibrate with its spinning. Wugh! it would
sound, as it burst far out of harm’s way, and then one could stand up in
the ‘Who’s afraid?’ style, to lie down again promptly as No. 2 came
along. How did I feel? you ask. Well, to be strictly honest, I didn’t
like it. I don’t believe any man really does, if it comes to that. Afterwards
a wounded man described his feelings very well to me; he said,
‘Do you know, I just felt as if I were outside the headmaster’s room,
in for a dashed good caning.’ And I think that hits off the sensation
exactly.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>But now the picturesquely vague must give place to the
explicit, and it would be impossible to summarise the position at
this stage more clearly than in the terse words of Colonel
Lumsden’s official despatch:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the evening of the 29th Colonel Ross received orders that the
corps was to make a demonstration next morning at daylight on the right
flank of the Boer lines for the purpose of drawing them from their
position and enabling the 14th Brigade, under General Maxwell, which
was to have come up on our right, to get behind and cut them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mounted Infantry portion of General Tucker’s division, under
Colonel Henry, joined hands with us at 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, half a mile from our camp.
A portion of my corps was ordered to occupy Gun Kopje, a position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>believed to be held by the Boers, about four miles distant on our right
front, the remainder extending and taking up positions on our left.
I went forward with the right flank, Major Showers accompanying
me. This portion consisted of the Adjutant, Captain Taylor, Captains
Rutherfoord, Clifford, and Chamney, Lieutenants Sidey and Pugh,
and four sections, the others having been detached by order of Colonel
Ross to hold various points. Mr. Pugh was sent out in advance with
the scouts, and it was when on this duty that Private Franks was shot.
Mr. Pugh very pluckily assisted him in getting on his horse and
endeavoured to take him out of the fire; but Franks was unable to stay
on his horse, and, dropping to the ground, had to be left. Mr. Pugh
and the remaining scouts were only just able to save themselves by
galloping up and joining us on the kopje at the extreme right, to which
we had just advanced, and which we held from 7 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> until ordered to
retire at about 1 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning I ordered Corporal Chartres with eight men to
occupy a kopje about 800 yards to our right and prevent the Boers turning
our flank. There they held their ground until ordered to fall back. It was
a small party for this important position, but in the circumstances no
more could be spared, I having only about sixty men with me, twenty of
whom, under Lieutenant Sidey, were detached by Colonel Ross to protect
the Vickers-Maxim (commonly styled ‘pom-pom’) in the centre of the
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following was then the general disposition:</p>

<p class='c000'>There were four ridges diverging northerly towards the enemy.
The extreme spur of the right ridge was held by myself with four
sections Lumsden’s Horse as described; the second held by Lieutenant
Crane and one section, he being directed there at the outset by Colonel
Ross; the third and fourth by the rest of the brigade, the two pom-poms
and our Maxim being at the head of the re-entrant between the second
and third ridges, with Captain Noblett and three sections on its left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after our arrival the Boers took up a position on a kopje about
1,500 yards directly in front, and quickly opened rifle fire on our position.
Fortunately the men had time to ensconce themselves behind rocks, and,
consequently, though bullets fell fast about them, they were able to maintain
a steady fire on the enemy without exposing themselves. It was
here, I deeply regret to say, that Major Showers met his death. He was
at the extreme right of the firing line and under a hot flanking fire from
the Boers, who had moved a party into a donga some 300 or 400 yards
to their left.</p>

<div id='i156'  class='figleft id010'>
<img src='images/i_b_156.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>CAPTAIN NEVILLE C. TAYLOR</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I personally begged him not to expose himself, as also did Captains
Chamney and Rutherfoord; but he would stand erect, using his field
glasses and presenting a most conspicuous mark for the enemy’s fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>which resulted fatally to him shortly after noon, a Mauser bullet entering
his right side half way down and coming out through his left arm above
the elbow. In risking his own life he had drawn a heavy fire on the spot
where he fell, and it was with much danger and difficulty that Captain
Powell, with Captain Chamney and others, succeeded in removing him
from the summit of the hill to a place of safety about thirty yards down.
I should like to take this opportunity of adding a few words by way of
tribute to the memory of Major Showers. When he heard of the corps
being raised, he was in command of the Surma Valley Light Horse in
Cachar, with the rank of Colonel, and was looked upon as one of the
smartest commanders of Volunteer
Cavalry in India. He wrote me
and said, ‘If you will take me as
your second in command, I will
gladly forfeit my rank and come
as Major.’ I may have made many
fortunate selections in choosing
my officers, but I never made a
wiser one than in selecting Colonel
Showers. A better or a braver
man never breathed, and his loss
to me so early in the campaign
was irreparable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after the commencement
of the Boer attack the whole
of the left were forced to retire
owing to their flank being turned,
taking one pom-pom and our
Maxim with them. Captain Noblett
was consequently obliged, at
about 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, to conform to this
movement, having no support, and
took his men out of the shell fire with great difficulty but had only a
few casualties.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Crane, receiving no orders to retire, and being detached
from me and unable to communicate with me or I with him, deemed it
his duty to retain his position as long as possible, which resulted in close
fighting and the loss of nearly half his section.</p>

<p class='c000'>One pom-pom and Lieutenant Sidey had been sent to the neck of
the right ridge to support us, we having been instructed to hold our
position until further orders. This pom-pom retired at about 12.30, and
at 1 o’clock Lieutenant Sidey and I both received our orders to retire.
This was carried out very deliberately, and the last of our men got out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>a most trying position within twenty minutes of having received our
orders, by moving away under cover of the ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we had kept up a decreasing fire until the men got mounted,
the Boers, fortunately for us, did not discover our retirement before we
were out of range, otherwise we should have suffered heavily. While
retiring, Private Burn-Murdoch’s horse was brought down by a stray
bullet, causing him a heavy fall and a nasty wound in his head.
Captain Chamney, who was near by at the time, with some assistance
got Murdoch on to his own horse and pluckily rode with him off the
field.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Captain Taylor, with much gallantry
and coolness, remained with
the led horses, and saw the last of
the men mounted and clear away
before he himself left, bringing up
the rear with Captain Clifford and
some late stragglers, including one
man who would stay for a last shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole brigade rendezvoused
at 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> behind a kopje about three
miles in rear and waited till 3, when
we returned to our various camps.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some reason the main attack
on our right under General
Maxwell had not been delivered,
and the object of the day was not
achieved. My corps alone had the
regrettable number of eighteen
casualties out of about 180 engaged.
This was mainly accounted for by
the position we held. The Maxim
under Captain Holmes did good
service, coming into action at 1,000
yards at a critical moment and checking the Boer advance for some time.
The enemy’s ‘Long Tom,’ however, soon found the Maxim out, and, as
the shells were bursting among the men with the gun horses, they were
ordered to retire only just in time, all the team being more or less wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot speak too highly of the gallant behaviour of my officers
and men throughout the day. Individual instances of heroism were
numerous, and I much fear that, especially in Mr. Crane’s section, many
of the casualties were caused by men endeavouring to assist their wounded
comrades. Mr. Crane himself was wounded in the groin, and I understand
Private Daubney’s and Private Case’s deaths were due to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>declining to leave their wounded officer. Judging from the number of
empty cartridge cases found beside them, they must have kept up a fire
on the advancing Boers to the last. Here Corporal Angus McGillivray,
Privates Leslie Gwatkin Williams, Firth, and R.N. Macdonald were
taken prisoners, along with Lieutenant Crane. Here fell Private
H.C. Lumsden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same evening about 4 o’clock Dr. Powell, with the ambulance
tonga, and Private Godden went out under the Red Cross flag to search for
the wounded, but in the gathering darkness were only able to reach the
body of Major Showers, who died previous to the retirement from our
position on the right where he fell. Captain Powell, in endeavouring to
return to camp, lost his way and had to remain during the night on the
veldt, reaching camp soon after daylight next morning. Shortly after his
arrival he returned with another search party, but found that the Boers
had already buried the bodies of Privates Case, Daubney, and Lumsden,
after having read the burial service over them. A stone had been put
over the head of Private Lumsden with his name scratched on it. The
reason for this, as narrated by Transport-Sergeant Stephens, is interesting.
When drivers were sent out with carts the following day, they met
several English-speaking Boers, ‘who would not talk much about the
fight, but said they were sorry our Colonel was killed. They had found
some papers in the pockets of young Lumsden, whom they took to be the
Colonel.’ The remains of Major Showers, being found still unburied,
were brought back and interred with military honours at the foot of the
kopje behind our camp. Private Franks, whose wounds had been dressed
by Captain Powell, had to be left on the hill near the body of Major
Showers, where he was found by the Boers shortly afterwards and received
every attention, but died during the night and was buried by them
in the morning. The Boers, subsequent to the fight, were most courteous
in their attentions, and returned papers, rings, watches, money, &amp;c., found
on the bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wish specially to mention a very plucky action done by Private
C.A. Walton, who is wounded and a prisoner in Pretoria. He was one
of the men in charge of the led horses in the No. 3 Section of A Company
when Sergeant Walker took temporary command of the section in Lieutenant
Neville’s absence on sick leave. On the order to retire Sergeant
Walker had to run some distance to his horse, and came back much
exhausted. The enemy being quite close on them, and Sergeant Walker’s
horse having been lost, Private Walton insisted on giving up his own
horse to the Sergeant, saying that he could run. While doing so he was
shot twice, and had to be left on the ground, although Sergeant Walker
did his utmost to take him along with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>After our return to camp I was much gratified to receive from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Colonel Ross, the Corps Commander, and Colonel Henry, the Brigade
Commander, congratulations on the behaviour of my officers and men
throughout the day, and on the morning following General Tucker,
the Divisional Commander, came over in person for a similar purpose;
but at the same time read me a lecture on the inadvisability of allowing
my men to attempt to bring off their wounded comrades when under fire.
He pointed out that it only drew fire on the wounded men and endangered
their own lives for no adequate result, as the Boers were a
very humane foe, who treated the wounded carefully. The troopers, he
said, must remember that their first duty as soldiers was to their Queen
and country.</p>

<p class='c000'>With deep regret I append a list of the casualties:</p>

<p class='c000'>Killed: Major Eden C. Showers—buried at Spytfontein; Privates
R.J. Clayton Daubeny, H.C. Lumsden, R.N. Case, Alfred F. Franks—buried
by the Boers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wounded: Lieutenant Crane; Paymaster David S. Fraser; Sergeant-Major
Cyril M.C. Marsham, bullet wounds through shoulders
and thigh; Lance-Sergeant J.S. Elliott, shell wound of right foot;
Sergeant F.S. McNamara, bullet wound in thigh; Private J.H. Burn-Murdoch,
fracture of frontal bone by fall from his horse, which was shot
under him during retirement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these Sergeant-Major Marsham, Lance-Sergeant Elliott, and Private
Burn-Murdoch are in hospital at Karree Siding, and Sergeant McNamara
rejoined for duty at Kroonstad.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Though General Tucker was constrained, by the wisest military
considerations, to rebuke men who, while displaying magnificent
qualities of courage and self-sacrifice in attempts to save their
wounded comrades, might have endangered the lives of others, we
may be sure that he made a mental reservation and wished in
his heart that he might have regiments of such men to lead. If
the records of his own gallant career have been truthfully kept, he
won promotion in the Bhootan expedition of 1866 and in fights
against the Zulus twelve years later, and paved the way to a
Knight Commandership of the Bath, not so much by obeying the
dictates of caution as by brilliant leadership and by conspicuous
valour that was almost reckless in its disregard of personal
danger. But he knew, with the intuition of a soldier’s quick
sympathies, that the corps to whose Colonel his words were
addressed wanted no incentive to boldness, but rather a lesson
in self-restraint. He had seen a great deal of their gallantry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>in that action for himself, and his brigadiers had told him
more. Lumsden’s Horse, at any rate, had no reason to be
ashamed of the way in which they had taken their ‘baptism
of fire.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The devotion of Corporal Firth in sticking to his wounded
officer, Lieutenant Crane, under a withering fire was a deed of
valour that should be famous throughout the Empire.</p>

<div id='i162'  class='figleft id010'>
<img src='images/i_b_162.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUTENANT C.E. CRANE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>All the men with Lieutenant Crane behaved very well. Two
non-commissioned officers and eleven troopers went with him
to hold the isolated kopje on the right flank. Of this gallant
party of fourteen, three were
killed, four were wounded and
taken prisoners, four escaped
with their clothes riddled with
bullet-holes but otherwise unhurt;
one, Corporal Firth,
could have escaped, but preferred
to remain with his
wounded officer, to bind up his
wounds if possible, to go with
him into captivity perhaps, to
share death with him if need
be. Troopers Reginald Macdonald
and Leslie Gwatkin
Williams also performed deeds
of splendid self-sacrifice. Of
those who escaped, Sergeant-Major
Marsham (wounded),
Bugler McKenzie, Sergeant
Walker, Lance-Sergeant J.S. Elliott (wounded), and Trooper
Radford, whose parting shot while he sat in the saddle brought
a Boer down, are deserving of the highest praise for the way in
which they stuck to the led horses and rode off with them under
heavy fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men were not tried veterans; they were taking their
parts in the first battle of their first campaign. But several of
them had been friends from their youth up, and all of them were
Anglo-Indians—men whose exile from the land of their birth
serves but to intensify their love for England and her greatness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Loyalty to friend and country! This is the magic touchstone
of the soldier’s discipline and heroism.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: J. Charlesworth</em></span><br />J.H. BURN-MURDOCH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Should any cynic dare to say that the men who did these
deeds were thirsting for glory, or inspired by a hope of winning
the Cross for Valour, or even conscious of doing more than a
common soldier’s duty demanded, let him read the narrative of
their actions, as told by themselves or their comrades, and
be answered! In the whole literature of war I know nothing
more realistic than Trooper Burn-Murdoch’s description of the
incident in which he was a
half-unconscious participator;
when lying wounded he was
taken from under fire by Captain
Chamney, and finally carried
out of action on horseback
in that officer’s arms. The
story is too characteristic of
the battlefield to bear mutilation.
For the sake of space,
though with reluctance, some
picturesque passages must be
sacrificed; but, for the rest, as
Trooper Burn-Murdoch told it
originally in his letters to the
‘Englishman,’ he shall tell it
again here:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The kopje which we had to hold
looked down on a sloping plain, and
at a distance varying from 700 to 1,100 yards off, and running nearly
parallel with our kopjes, was a deep dry river bed or donga. This donga
ran right up towards the Boer position. In my humble opinion we
should have done better to have placed some dismounted men in
this donga, and so prevented the enemy using it as a zigzag trench
or covered way towards our position. Instead of this, we literally
stuck to the kopje. And in the early part of the fight I noticed,
and drew my mates’ attention to the fact, that a lot of Boers were
riding towards this river bed, but never seemed to cross it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the day wore on our position on these kopjes became somewhat
too warm to be pleasant. And, judging by the whistle of the bullets, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>seemed to have the enemy on our left flank as well as in front. It was
about this time that our gallant Major, who scorned to take cover, got two
mortal bullet wounds through his lungs; our doctor very pluckily set to
and cut off his tunic and plugged the bullet-holes, quite regardless of the
heavy fire he was subjected to. But it was of no use; in a few moments
the brave old soldier breathed his last. All he said was, ‘Ah, well, I’m
done for ... it’s not so bad as I should have expected.’ But there was
no time now to think of him or any other poor wounded comrade.</p>

<p class='c000'>On we went, blazing away for dear life at the well-hidden enemy.
Flat on our empty stomachs, wriggling from one stone to another, never
daring to raise one’s head above a few inches from the ground. Whish!
whish! phew! phew! came those deadly nickels, then ping-r-r-r would
sound the ricocheting shots as they struck the stones and rocks a few
inches from our faces, and shot up into the clear blue sky behind us with
a shriek of unquenched bloodthirstiness. Thicker and thicker they came—and
now we saw that the enemy were straight in front of us, having,
as I had expected, ridden up under the cover of the river bed. Orders
now came for us to retreat slowly from the right. So as soon as my turn
came I let blaze a few rapid parting shots, and then ‘sniped’ back over
the ridge to where Trooper Ducat was holding my sub-section’s horses.
I can tell you that was an exciting little bit of a sprint, and the bullets
striking all around me did not tend to retard my movements. However,
I got back all right, and a few seconds later Trooper Stevenson turned
up. As Trooper Thelwall had not joined us, I waited a few minutes
with his horse. And rather an anxious wait that was. As he did not,
however, arrive, I presumed that some Boer bullet had found him out.
But I tied his horse to a stump in case he did come, and then, mounting,
I galloped after the rest. It was uncommonly lucky that I did tie up
his horse, as he afterwards, during a slight lull in the firing, managed to
make a bolt over the kopje and down to his horse. One often hears it
said that Mounted Infantry do not need to be much of riders so long
as they can shoot straight. All I can say is, let a bad rider try to
mount a fresh horse, with a large kit on the saddle and a heavy
rifle in his left hand, and bullets and pom-pom shells whistling and
cracking around, and he will agree with me in saying that every Mounted
Infantryman ought to be a very fair rider before he can be of much use
in a fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gathering up my reins, I kept up a good gallop towards our next
kopje, and was just congratulating myself that I was too skinny a target
for any Boer bullets when poor old Demon came down with a fearful
crash, shot by a Mauser bullet. I suppose I must have been stunned
by the fall, as I have no recollection of seeing him again. When I came
to, I found that my neck was fearfully stiff and sore, likewise all the left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>side of my head. And pain—by Jove! pain was no word for it. I lay
there cursing and crawling about for some time, and was momentarily
expecting to have a ‘sighting shot’ into me, when, bang! and I remembered
no more. I have since heard that after this two of our chaps came
along and, dismounting, turned me over and left me as a ‘green
’un.’ I remember dimly wondering what time of day it was, as all
things seemingly were so dim and dark that I could not see. I then
thought of tying up my head with my field dressing; but whether I did
so or not I could not swear, as I was more or less ‘silly.’ It must have
been a pom-pom or some other kind of shell bursting near me that
did the damage. Recovering a certain amount of sensibility, I was
endeavouring to get under some cover when Captain Chamney rode up.
He shouted out to me apparently from a long distance off, as I could just
hear him, ‘Hello, Mud’ook, what the tivil are you doing here? Badly
hurt are ye? Come on, then, get a hold of my stirrup an’ I’ll take ye
along wi’ me; ye’r far and away too good a man to leave behind.’
I told him, of course, to go on, as I was all right and would get behind a
rock and have a rest; but the good old ‘Oirishman’ told me to get up at
once as he ordered. And a good job it was, too, he did <em>order</em> me to
do so, or I’d have been resting there now. Just then Trooper Ducat
came galloping up, and the two of them got me between them and
trotted me along some hundreds of yards—it seemed miles to me.
At last I got nearly unconscious, merely rolling along in a sort of
mechanical style. But, try as much as I could, what with loss of
blood and giddiness I could go no further, and as I was a mere dead
weight on my two companions they halted, and I next remember
myself sitting behind Captain Chamney with my blood sopping down his
neck and khaki tunic, my head resting on his shoulder, and my hands
locked round his body. How I got there I don’t know. I suppose they
lifted me up somehow. Anyhow, there I was, and the good old commandeered
Free Stater carried us well. I don’t remember much of that
ride. Somebody else rode up alongside of me—I think it was Trooper
Stevenson—and he, being Scotch, and therefore ‘economical,’ had pluckily
picked up my rifle. So, with Ducat on one side and Stevenson on the
other, alternately digging me in the ribs, I managed to hold on until we
got to cover; and here Ducat, who, luckily for me, was a doctor, bound
me up and gave me a drink. Gad! I was thirsty. Shortly afterwards
one of Danjeboy’s Nepaulese ambulance tongas, which we had brought
over from India with us, galloped up, and I was put inside. I don’t
think that worthy Ghoorka driver liked the sound of Mausers any better
than I did, for he simply galloped the whole way. Over stones, over
scrub, over ruts. I shall never forget that ride. However, I got to the
camp all right, and willing hands carried me to my tent, where I lay till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>dark with only a greatcoat for a pillow and a good solid piece of natural
veldt for a bed. Towards evening Ducat came in, and with great kindness
went and made me some cornflour, which I was able to eat. This was
the first food I had had, barring three or four mouthfuls of stale bread,
since 5 o’clock the night before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Powell came back from the fight later. He had been tending the
wounded and dying there. Tired and weary as he was, he at once set to
and tied my head up, first shaving off some of my hair. I don’t remember
much after this. I remember Sergeant Elliott (of Edinburgh) was
brought into the tent with his foot shattered by a pom-pom, and we
groaned out a duet throughout that night. In the fight Elliott was
holding some horses when a pom-pom shell burst in their midst, shattering
Elliott’s foot and finishing off several horses, including his own.
Managing to get hold of another mount, he rode up and reported himself
to Captain Noblett, by whom he was of course ordered to the rear. So,
badly wounded as he was, Elliott rode those five miles back to camp
unaided. Next day or the day after—I do not remember exactly, as I was
unconscious for two or three days, off and on—the ambulance waggons
drove up, and into them we were shoved. Colonel Lumsden, Captain
Noblett, Captain Chamney, and Sergeant Hewitt, I think, all were there,
seeing us off and helping us to ‘keep our peckers up.’ My one complaint
was that Captain Chamney wanted to shave off my moustache when he
was doing the V.C. trick on the veldt. I asked him why he wanted to.
He was much surprised at the question, and told me in answer that
‘there were too many Boers doing the shaving for him to think of it
himself.’ I must have imagined the whole thing, I suppose, when I was
lying ‘silly.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another incident which was referred to briefly by Colonel
Lumsden, who for obvious reasons did not make much of it, is
thus described in detail by Trooper Preston:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse was to do the work of advance guard and scouts.
No. 2 Section, B Company, was chosen for the scouting, and immediately
sent out, and very soon the whole of the 8th Mounted Infantry
was spread over the plain. One sub-section (Troopers Franks, Were,
Powis, and myself) were scouting ahead of everyone else. For the first
three or four miles the ground was fairly level, with a few small kopjes
with trees on them. Then there was a ridge of kopjes with a steep valley
behind, and then another ridge. The scouts got to the first ridge of
kopjes before seeing anyone, then two shots were heard in the distance,
and a man on a big roan horse was seen galloping away. As the scouts
rode between two kopjes on the first ridge, about sixteen men were seen
to come out from the top of the ridge; immediately the scouts halted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>looked at them through their field-glasses, and saw they were dressed in
khaki. Before the scouts started they had been told to look out for some
of General French’s men on their right. One of the officers coming up
then (Lieutenant H.O. Pugh) looked at them, and saw the same as the
others—that they were dressed in khaki. The scouts then rode round
the kopje, intending to meet them. By this time the sixteen men had
got down into the valley, and were making up the steep hill on the
other side to the top of the kopje. Trooper Franks and I then went
down the valley, intending to see who they were, while the other
two went on to the right. The men had by this time got on to the
sky-line, some dismounting and
others sitting still. We rode half
way down the valley (which was
about two hundred yards across),
and then halted and looked through
our glasses. The men on the top
then shouted out something and
began to fire at us, so we turned and
galloped for our lives. Trooper
Franks, after riding about three
hundred yards, began reeling in his
saddle and tumbled off. Lieutenant
Pugh and a few men then galloped
up to him and found he was shot
through the back and stomach.
The bullets meanwhile were raining
about them. Franks begged us to
leave him, saying that as soon as we
were gone the Boers would stop firing;
so Lieutenant Pugh gave the
order to leave him and return to the
others, who by this time were lining
the ridge behind, Lumsden’s Horse having the highest kopje to hold. As
soon as our Colonel heard Franks was wounded he started off on foot, with
Troopers Betts, Percy Smith, and Chapman, to fetch him. The Boers
immediately advanced down their side of the valley, and began firing at the
Colonel and his party. However, they were prepared for this, and after
a few shots the Boers retired, the Colonel bringing Franks in on his own
horse and walking beside.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Then we got the word passed to retire from the
right. Perfect order was maintained, the men retiring one by one, the
others keeping up a continuous fire until their turn came. At last everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>had got away except Lieutenant Crane and three or four more, whom
the order to retire never reached. The Colonel and Adjutant were
among the last to go away. The behaviour of the men was just as if
they had been accustomed to that kind of thing all their lives, smoking,
and firing at the same time, others lying behind rocks and writing letters
to their relations and sweethearts. The Boers did not follow us up, and
we reached camp safely, but very sad for the losses we had sustained.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another version of these incidents, with such minor differences
as help to give a clear conception of the whole scene, is
furnished by the Special Correspondent of the ‘Indian Daily
News,’ who, after describing the lucky escape of one scout,
writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Trooper A.F. Franks, of the same sub-section, the very best of
fellows and liked by everyone, was not so lucky, poor fellow. He
accompanied Lieutenant H.O. Pugh in advance, but, seeing nothing,
Franks suggested that he should go forward to the top of the donga
or nullah in which they were standing; but on reaching the top he
was confronted by thirty or forty of the enemy about three hundred
yards away. They beckoned to him and spoke to him in Dutch,
presumably inquiring who he was; without waiting for a reply, however,
they opened fire, and Franks then turned and retired. He had not
gone far before he was struck, the bullet going through his back and
coming out just below the heart. He managed to stick on his saddle till
he reached Lieutenant Pugh, who caught his horse by the head and led
him towards the kopje above mentioned as occupied by us. Franks was
in such pain that he was unable to bear the jolting of the horse, and so
he had to be laid down on the plain for the time being. Lieutenant Pugh
and other men who had come up in the meantime then retired to the
kopje to report the state of affairs to Colonel Lumsden. All this time,
of course, the bullets were whistling about, and the wonder is that
not more of us were shot. Two men were then sent in search of
our doctor, and Colonel Lumsden, as soon as he heard what had happened,
immediately ordered his horse and, accompanied by his orderly,
Percy Smith, of A Company, and Private H.N. Betts, of B Company,
on horseback—Private Chapman, of B Company, having previously gone
down on foot on the same errand of mercy—rode forward to the spot. On
reaching it our gallant Colonel insisted on dismounting and placing
Franks on his horse, saying the animal was a quiet one, and, notwithstanding
the urgent requests of the others that he would allow them to
give up one of their horses to him, he insisted on walking the whole distance,
quite regardless of the hail of bullets round him. Progress was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>naturally slow, as Franks complained of severe pain, but at last the kopje
was reached, none of the party getting a scratch. They had a narrow
escape; the Boers had evidently got the range to a nicety. They
then started a brisk rifle fire on the kopje we were on, which we returned
at every opportunity, but they kept themselves so well under cover that
we had very poor chances of doing them any serious damage from our
side. They gradually crept up closer and closer, coming down by twos
and threes from a kopje about two thousand yards away, and taking up
their position eventually behind a slope eight to nine hundred yards distant.
A regular artillery duel, several of their shells bursting among the pom-poms
and our own Maxim, but not doing much damage. I fancy our
guns did a bit of killing, though the Boers afterwards acknowledged to
four wounded only; our Maxim gave a very good account of itself.
I understand our only casualties in this direction were two or three
wounded horses. We were told afterwards that the day’s operations
were only intended to be a reconnaissance in force to find out the enemy’s
strength and position, after which large forces from the left and right
would attempt to surround them. This being the case, at about 12
(we had been under fire for about four hours) a general retirement
was ordered from the right. The Boers, seeing us retiring, were
evidently emboldened to throw aside their usual cautious tactics, and
advanced on us rapidly, very nearly rushing the kopje on which we
were before we could get away. The writer’s horse, which had been tied
to a tree, got away, and he would have been badly left, as in the hasty
retreat we were obliged to make it was impossible to say who had
gone on and who was left behind, but fortunately ‘Molly Riley,’ Mrs.
Barrow’s well-known paper-chaser, was standing near a bush close by, and
Private Were, who was just going off, stopped behind and helped to get
hold of ‘Molly Riley.’ We then started to gallop off, but just then
another man came running towards us much exhausted with scrambling
down the kopje, and Were, saying he was quite fresh, pluckily got
off and lent him his horse. Fortunately at that moment Captain Taylor,
our Adjutant, galloped up with a spare horse, and, Were getting mounted,
we all made away for our lives. We halted at a place some distance off,
and it was only then we heard of our long tale of casualties. A Company
suffered very heavily on the left flank, where part of them were lying in an
exposed position. Besides this, there were several men missing, and it was
not till we got into camp in the evening after roll-call was taken that the
exact extent of our loss was known. Franks was left on the kopje with
an orderly, as it was impossible to move him, and we heard next day that
he was taken to the Boer hospital, and died there at 12 o’clock the same
night. Among the wounded was Paymaster-Sergeant D.S. Fraser, well
known in sporting circles in Calcutta. He had his horse shot under him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and was himself wounded in the thigh and captured by the Boers. Our
ambulance went out next day and found that the Boers had buried all
the dead, except Major Showers, whose body was brought back to camp
and buried there. The service was a very impressive one, and was conducted
by the Military Chaplain attached to the regiment camped close
by. It was calculated to bring home to us all the stern realities of war.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Yet in a trooper’s diary immediately after the most pathetic
entry we find it recorded that when rations were to be distributed
by a process of division and subdivision ‘B—— argued
at great length that one-fourth of two-thirds could not be the
same as two-thirds of one-fourth,’ and the discussion took a
heated turn. Such are the trifles that seem important to men
who have just come out of a battle in which perhaps they were
more than once close to the jaws of death. ‘Linesman,’ in those
brilliant impressions of the war in Natal—always truthful in fact,
but not invariably just in deduction—has recorded a very similar
incident at Vaal Krantz, when, from a fire that was deafening,
bewildering in its intensity of concentration on the British front,</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c023'>some died, some were carried away on dripping stretchers before they
could learn the full gamut. And the survivors? The few within the
writer’s ken—quarrelled! During a lucid interval in the shelling, the
regimental cooks had contrived to make and distribute tea to the men
lying prone in their shelters. The distribution was not perhaps impartial.
The menace of a 94-lb. shrapnel would make a liquor-measure uncertain
with the eyes of a hundred Government inspectors glued upon it! So
there arose a bickering. Tom down below must obviously have taken
more than his share, else how came it that Mick above had to content
himself with less? ‘Peace!’ yelled the monstrous shrapnel at the
height of the argument; ‘Shut up!’ snapped the pom-pom shells;
‘Silence!’ boomed the far-off 40-pounder. Not a bit of it. No foreign-made
projectile ever fired shall stop a Briton well under way with a
grievance. That argument flourished amazingly under the shower, and
only died away when the glaring sun overhead began to induce an
unforgiving slumber.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Ridiculous, of course, such a scene must seem to civilians who
have been fed on the heroics of a melodramatic school, or
on the still falser ‘revelations’ of writers who, having never
seen a battle, mix their own pusillanimous imaginings with
so-called ‘psychological’ studies and ironically brand that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>mixture with the ‘red badge of courage’; but it is true to the
nature of soldiers who are not always thinking great things while
they do them, and who have often a laugh or an oath on their
lips when their thoughts take a flight too serious for words.
Burn-Murdoch has told us how, in the midst of a duel that was
practically for life or death between some Boers and Lumsden’s
Horse in this fight at Ospruit, men laughed outright at something
that seemed to them ‘tearfully funny, coming as it did
like the comedian’s joke in the middle of a tragedy.’ A soldier
should make the best of valets because he is never a hero to
himself. Yet he has a firm and never-to-be-shaken faith in the
heroism of others. Lumsden’s Horse, many of them in imminent
peril at the moment, watched their Colonel’s action in going out
to bring the wounded Trooper Franks from a shot-withered slope
to some place of comparative safety, and they afterwards declared
it to be a valorous deed well worthy of the Victoria Cross. To
that conclusion Sir Patrick Playfair also came when the story
was told to him, and he said so. Thereupon Colonel Lumsden
was much upset lest somebody might say that he, too, had been
trying to win the coveted distinction. So he hastened to write
a ‘disclaimer’ in these words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>What Sir Patrick really means, and heard about from some of my
men, referred to the death of poor Franks, who was lying wounded on the
veldt about 800 yards from the point we held on the extreme right of the
fighting line. We could see him plainly through our glasses writhing
evidently in great pain; and, as I asked for some volunteers to ride down
and bring him in, I did not care to request them to do a thing I would
not do myself, so rode down with my galloper, Trooper Percy Smith, now
a captain in the Middlesex Regiment and a D.S.O., and Trooper Betts and
Trooper Chapman, the latter of whom afterwards obtained a commission
in the Johannesburg Police.</p>

<p class='c000'>On reaching the spot we found Franks lying in great danger and pain.
Having a quiet pony, ‘Harry Stuart,’ I dismounted, and we placed the
wounded man on my horse, and while he was held by two of his comrades
we walked back to camp under a pretty heavy fire from some Boers who
were galloping on our left rear and firing at us. It was a foolish thing
on my part to have done, but, as I said, we were all new to the game
together, and I did not care to ask my men to risk their lives in an action in
which I would not chance my own. That is all. There was nothing in it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Yes, that is all! But let England, mother of nations, thank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>God for the sons who, doing such a deed, can say and think
‘there was nothing in it’!</p>

<p class='c000'>Cold reason may bid us approve General Charles Tucker’s
words of wise caution, but all the time our hearts will be beating
time to a noble refrain, the notes of which have thrilled the
nerves of British soldiers in all ages, urging them to risk their
own lives rather than forsake a stricken comrade, and to die like
gentlemen before they would let the stain of dishonour rest on
them or their regiment. People who talk glibly of the necessity
for encouraging initiative among junior officers may hold that
Lieutenant Crane should have conformed to the general retirement,
instead of holding his isolated post with untimely resolution,
waiting for the orders that could not reach him, when
the Boers began to close in on his front and flanks. Apparently
no blame attaches to anybody for neglecting to recall Lieutenant
Crane and his party at a time when they might have extricated
themselves without serious loss. Colonel Ross says that the orderly
whom he sent with the message was either killed or wounded, and
so the recall never reached Lieutenant Crane. That it was sent
both Colonel Ross and his Staff officer, Captain Williams (who has
since been killed), were quite positive. In justice to Lieutenant
Crane, it must be remembered that a company officer can know
very little of what is going on at other points of a fighting line
beyond the immediate limits assigned to him, and the privilege of
initiative might be strained to a dangerous extent if every section-leader
should consider it discreet to retire directly he found himself
pressed sorely or somebody else giving way on either flank.
In Colonel Lumsden’s words—so eloquent because of their
undemonstrative simplicity—Lieutenant Crane ‘deemed it his
duty to hold his position as long as possible.’ How many
thousands of times in the course of our ‘rough island story’ has
the Empire had cause to be thankful to the men who could thus
interpret duty as a thing above all personal considerations,
calling for self-sacrifice to the end! It was part of the white
man’s burden which Lieutenant Crane and his comrades of No. 2
Section had taken upon them long ago, when they settled as
indigo-planters in the wilds of Behar, Mozufferpore, and Saran,
where Europeans are few and natives many. In such districts
the Sahib’s lot may be to face a riotous multitude of frenzied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fanatics at any moment, and he must fight it out single-handed,
dying if need be under cruel torture, but never showing fear. That
was the training-school from which No. 2 Section of A Company
came. They were indigo-planters to a man, self-reliant and
imbued with a high sense of the Sahib’s responsibility to the
race from which he springs. Knowing this, we cannot wonder
that the leader deemed it his duty to fight for the ground he had
been ordered to hold rather than give way an inch, no matter
what odds were against him; or that, when he fell wounded, with
Clayton Daubney, Henry Lumsden, and Upton Case dead beside
him, others chose to share his fate instead of leaving him to the
tender mercies of their enemies. To such men no thought of surrender
could have come. Corporal Firth had a chance of getting
away, but he went back to where his wounded officer and some
old comrades from Mozufferpore were lying under heavy fire, and
elected to stay with them as they held the Boers in check until
nearly every cartridge was expended. Not before Daubney,
Case, and Lumsden had been killed, Cyril Marsham, Stewart
McNamara, Helme Firth, Gwatkin Williams, McGillivray, and
Macdonald wounded did the Boers succeed in making any
prisoners among the little band of indigo-planters, whom they
had by that time practically surrounded within point-blank range.
No white flag was hoisted and there were no ‘hands up,’ but
rifles dropped from the nerveless grip of men who had fought till
they were faint with loss of blood and there was no power in the
numb fingers to press a trigger. Others laid down the weapons
that were useless when their last cartridge had been fired; and
then the Boers, closing in upon them, made prisoners of all who
survived. If anybody blundered, the mistake was nobly atoned
for. It is a story of which Lumsden’s Horse and the whole
Empire may be proud.</p>

<p class='c000'>An early version of this incident, not quite accurate in some
details, furnished a noble theme for the pen of Sir A. Conan Doyle,
who, in his history of ‘The Great Boer War,’ writes, with a
patriot’s enthusiasm and an enthusiast’s glorious disregard of
fettering figures, as follows:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Before entering upon a description of that great and decisive movement
(the advance on Pretoria), one small action calls for comment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>This was the cutting off of twenty<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> men of Lumsden’s Horse in a
reconnaissance at Karree. The small post under Lieutenant Crane found
themselves by some misunderstanding isolated in the midst of the enemy.
Refusing to hoist the flag of shame, they fought their way out, losing
half<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> their number, while of the other half it is said that there was not
one who could not show bullet marks upon his clothes or person. The
men of this corps, Volunteer Anglo-Indians, had abandoned the ease and
even luxury of Eastern life for the hard fare and rough fighting of this most
trying campaign. In coming they had set the whole Empire an object-lesson
in spirit, and now on their first field they set the Army an example
of military virtue. The proud traditions of Outram’s Volunteers have
been upheld by the men of Lumsden’s Horse.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Unsympathetic critics may discover a lack of due proportion in
the space that has been devoted to this affair at Ospruit, seeing
that it was but an episode in a long chain of operations, the
whole of which are dealt with in a single paragraph of the
Commander-in-Chief’s despatches.
But the same argument
might be urged against
any enlargement in monograph
on the official version of
Brigadier-General Mahon’s
brilliant march for relieving
Mafeking, to which no writer
has done full justice yet,
though there is evidence that
the Boers regarded it as the
first ‘slim thing’ achieved by
a British commander, and as
a stroke of daring leadership
by which they were completely
outwitted. Many similar
examples, not so conspicuous
perhaps, but all material in
their bearing on the greater
issues of a campaign, and therefore
worthy of elaborate treatment in detail, might be quoted.
The Editor can at any rate plead that this is a history of
Lumsden’s Horse, and not an essay in perspective. For that
reason he has chosen to reproduce impressions of the different
incidents, not as they might have presented themselves to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>mind of a divisional general or an unemotional spectator, but as
they burnt themselves in upon the brains of men actually fighting
for their lives, and to use as nearly as possible each writer’s own
words. It may seem strange that through all these narratives,
from the Colonel’s purposely restrained and undemonstrative
summary to the details that are told with most convincing force,
we can trace no signs of depression resulting from the fact that
Lumsden’s Horse in their first fight were forced to retire instead
of taking part in a victorious advance. This is a touch happily
characteristic of British soldiers. Conscious of having done
their duty manfully, they were content to let the issue be what
it might, so long as they had not lost confidence in themselves
or in their leaders. There was nothing of the beaten soldier
about them; no demoralisation, no sullen discontent, no sham
heroics covering a sense of discomfiture. Whether they had to
come back from their sacrifices because the enemy was in
superior force, or simply because the object of a reconnaissance
‘had been achieved,’ mattered little to them. As Tommy would
have phrased it in his expressive way, ‘it was all in the day’s
work.’ Victory is sweet, no doubt, and men from whose lips
that cup has been dashed cannot but feel a little bitterness in
their hearts, but it is only the bitterness of a wholesome tonic.
For soldiers who have suffered so there is always consolation in
the knowledge that their sacrifices were not borne in vain. And
Lumsden’s Horse may take satisfaction from the thought that
their first fight, with all its sad and glorious consequence, was
not brought about by any useless demonstration without plan or
purpose. Though none of them could know it at the time, they
had been engaged with De la Rey’s force, by which General Ian
Hamilton’s left flank was being seriously threatened along the
Brandfort ridges, and their action, which seemed to them indecisive,
had so far relieved the pressure that Sir Ian was able
the next day to deliver his attack on Houtnek and drive the
Boers from it in some confusion. The apparent failure of
General Maxwell’s brigade to carry out the mission assigned to it
in the flanking movement mentioned by Colonel Lumsden may
be accounted for by the fact that some of the Brandfort commandos,
finding themselves in danger of being cut off, had
drawn back from the contemplated movement against Ian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Hamilton and thrown themselves into the fight that was then
raging about the spurs and kopjes of the range from which
Ospruit springs. Thus they outnumbered many times the
mounted troops under Colonel Henry, who, having achieved his
object, wisely retired from the left, leaving the Boers in occupation
of the ground they had won, but leaving them also held firmly in
check there by Infantry brigades, whose presence prevented any
further demonstration from Brandfort against Ian Hamilton’s
left. When Lumsden’s Horse marched back to their camp that
night, therefore, they might have congratulated themselves—though
they didn’t—on having done remarkably good service by
something more than a reconnaissance in force. The immediate
result may be summed up in a few words. General Hamilton,
reinforced by another Infantry brigade and by General Broadwood’s
Cavalry, who rejoined him from Thaba ’Nchu way during
the night, was enabled to advance early on May 1 and strike a
strong blow by which, as Lord Roberts said in his despatch,
‘the enemy was signally defeated at Houtnek with comparatively
small loss on our side, thanks to the admirable dispositions made
by Major-General Ian Hamilton.’ To this comment Lord
Roberts adds an expression of regret that the troops employed at
Dewetsdorp and Wepener had been unable to cut off the enemy’s
retreat and capture his guns; but during these operations the
Boers, being evidently prepared for retreat whenever their
safety might be threatened, moved with very little baggage, each
fighting man carrying his blankets and food on a led horse. It
followed, therefore, that they could escape without suffering any
loss beyond that inflicted by our troops in dislodging them from
their positions. This was practically the official explanation, to
which one may add that Cavalry alone could not follow up
effectively the retreat of Mounted Infantry every man of which
knew the country and how to utilise its peculiarities for checking
pursuit. By his masterly stroke at Houtnek, however, General
Hamilton had achieved something more than the capture of a
Boer stronghold. At the end of that action his troops were
astride of the most formidable defensive position between Bloemfontein
and Vaal River, and an unopposed advance two days
later to Isabellafontein not only took the enemy’s entrenchments
on that side of Brandfort completely in reverse, but also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>effectually prevented De Wet from co-operating with De la Rey
or Botha, and thus opened a way for the general movement
towards Pretoria. Thus the fight at Ospruit, though it ended
in a retirement against which some of the more adventurous
spirits chafed, was a demonstration that helped materially
towards the development of more important schemes; and to
Lumsden’s Horse belongs the honour of having given to this
affair an imperishable distinction by sacrifices that may have
been unnecessary but were certainly not inglorious. The men
who risked their lives and liberty, as Firth, Macdonald, and
Williams did, in gallant efforts to rescue their wounded officer
from a position which he had attempted to hold too long, are as
worthy to be remembered as those who met their deaths in the
fighting line. To the fallen, monuments have already been
raised. Above the grave of young Harry Lumsden, who was
buried beside Daubney and Case on the battlefield, a cross was
put up by the Boers themselves, who, finding letters in his
pocket, mistook him for the Colonel commanding Lumsden’s
Horse, and buried him with the respect that they considered due
to a brave enemy and leader of men. In the old camp at Spytfontein,
to which the body of Major Showers was borne the next
day, another simple memorial, pathetically distinguished by its
loneliness, was raised by the comrades who paid their sorrowing
tribute to him there, but brought away memories of his soldierly
qualities, which they have honoured since by a more sumptuous
monument in Bengal. The old soldier would probably have
wished for no higher honour than the esteem of comrades whom
he had trained in times of peace, and among whom he fell in
their first fight. How sincere that esteem was may be gathered
from simple narratives sent home by officers and men of
Lumsden’s Horse, whose letters give incidental glimpses of
heroic actions that might otherwise have passed into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant-Colonel W.R. Walker, officiating commandant,
issued the following regimental order from the headquarters of
the Surma Valley Light Horse, Silchar, dated July 10, 1900:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>As everybody connected with the corps will no doubt wish to hear
details of the death in action of our late Commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel
Eden C. Showers, I publish for information below particulars from a letter
received by the Adjutant from Captain Chamney, of Lumsden’s Horse,
written the day after the action in which Colonel Showers lost his life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Captain Chamney says: Our corps were given the honour of the
advance, the S.V.L.H. the honour of the first of that, and with Lumsden
and old Showers at our head we occupied the kopje that was said to be the
key of the whole position, but were instantly subjected to a heavy musketry
fire. We lost one man and horse scouting, and then got settled down
among some sangars, but the old Major scorned all cover, watching,
absolutely regardless of the bullets, the enemy’s advance up a spruit on
our right flank. Everyone had asked him to get down, but he always said,
‘Oh, I’m all right,’ and walked from one end of the line to the other. When
all the rest had begun to retire, and we got no word, the Boers worked up
closer and closer. I had only just said to him (he was but three or four
yards behind me), ‘For God’s sake, Major, get under cover,’ when I heard
the sing of bullets over my head and ‘plint,’ and, looking round, I saw he
was hit. I said, ‘Are you hit, Major?’ and he replied, ‘Oh, nothing much,
only my arm; send back for Dr. Powell.’ I crawled back on my belly to
him and got his belts and things opened, and found also a big hole, just
above the heart, which was bleeding copiously. Then Dr. Powell and two
assistants came up, and we bandaged him as well as we could for bullets
flying around, and, still on our bellies, pulled and lifted the old chap out
of the range of fire. He was suffering evidently a good deal from suffocation;
blood in his lungs, I suppose. I stayed with him as long as he was
conscious—not many minutes—and had then to return to the men. I found
him as we retired a little later there under the tree where we had laid him, and
where we had to leave him and another man to the Boers. The ‘Retire’
came before he died, and Dr. Powell, making up his mind to stay with him,
fixed his handkerchief to a stick to get what protection he could from it.
However, the old chap dropped off, and, covering him with a blanket and
closing his eyes, the Doctor left him to his rest and bolted, but, looking
back, he saw the white flag, and saying, ‘What would the old man say
if he knew he was taken, even dead, with a white flag over him?’ returned
and took it down, and so we left him. The Boers took nothing but his
spurs and badges. Dr. Powell returned at night under a Red Cross and
got permission to remove the body to-day and we bury the old man this
afternoon. It is a terrible loss to the corps, and all so utterly sad.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>There is something almost Homeric in that incident of the
white flag being taken from beside the dead warrior’s body under
fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ‘Times of India’ of May 9, 1900, contains the following
appreciation of the gallant Major Showers:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Among those of Lumsden’s Horse killed in the fighting in the Orange
Free State on the 30th ult. was Major Eden Showers. He was until
recently the Commandant of the Surma Valley Light Horse, and by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>example exercised a wonderful influence over all ranks. He was a son
of General Showers, who did splendid work in the Mutiny days, and made
his name famous by his courageous leading of the assault at Delhi
on September 13, 1857. Major Showers was educated at Wellington
College, and entered the Army through Sandhurst in 1865. He served
in the Dublin Fusiliers, the two battalions of which are now in Natal, one
having been in Ladysmith and the other with the relieving force under
General Buller. After serving with the regiment for nearly seven years
the deceased officer left it with the rank of Adjutant, and joined the
2nd Life Guards, with which he remained for three years. After ten
years’ service he left the army to take up tea-planting. He worked for
some years at Katalguri under Messrs. Macniell &amp; Co., but at the close
of the season 1881-82 joined Messrs. Octavius Steel &amp; Co., and was
Superintendent of their Cherra Gardens up to the time he resigned to
join Lumsden’s Horse. He was elected by his brother planters to command
the Surma Valley Light Horse in March 1895, in succession to
Colonel Milne, C.I.E., and his nomination was ratified by the Government.
The selection proved that the Government had put the right man in
the right place. While in command he worked the Light Horse up to a
high degree of efficiency, as was shown by the approval of General Sir
George Luck, who at the inspection in December last gave them unstinted
praise. Among other things, the General stated that he could
honestly say that the regiment could hold its own with the best Yeomanry
corps at home, which was saying a great deal. Shortly after his resignation
of the command of the Surma Valley Light Horse, Colonel Showers
joined Lumsden’s Horse as Second-in-Command, with the rank of Major,
serving under his old friend and former subordinate, Colonel Lumsden.
His death is a severe loss to the corps, and is deeply deplored by a very large
circle of friends, who found in him a man of sterling merit, splendid character,
and a credit to the military profession he was so keen in following.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The following appears in the ‘Assam Gazette’:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The Officiating Chief Commissioner expresses the general feeling of
the Province in deploring the death in action of Major E.C. Showers,
Second-in-Command of the Indian Mounted Infantry Corps (Lumsden’s
Horse) now serving in South Africa. As Commandant of the Surma
Valley Light Horse for nearly five years he brought that body to a high
state of efficiency by his soldierly qualities, his untiring devotion to the
interests of the corps, and by his personal popularity among its members.
His untimely death is a serious loss to Assam, and will be mourned by
the officers and men of the corps. He was loved by all who knew him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Hon. H.J.S. Cotton, Chief Commissioner of Assam (now
Sir Henry Cotton, K.C.S.I.), presiding at the Assam Dinner in
London in June 1900, paid the following tribute to Major Showers:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Another gentleman had been pathetically alluded to both by Colonel
Kirwan and Colonel MacLaughlin, and the mention of his name recalled
a recent public dinner at Cachar, given as a send-off to Colonel Showers
and other Volunteers. The admiration which all the Volunteers of
Assam had for Colonel Showers was, indeed, a thing to have witnessed.
When he rose to propose Colonel Showers’s health the cheering was
vociferous and so continuous that it was at least ten minutes before he
could get any hearing. He had never been present at a scene of such
extraordinary enthusiasm, and he believed it was thoroughly well deserved.
Colonel Showers was an exceptional man; thoroughly straightforward
and practical, and a born leader of men. What was said of Jim Bludso
might with equal truth be said of Colonel Showers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A keerless man in his talk was Jim,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And an awkward hand in a row;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he never funked and he never lied:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I reckon he never know’d how.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That was the type of man that Colonel Showers was—a simple-minded
Englishman, true and staunch as steel, and courageous to the backbone.
As Colonel Kirwan had told them, he died, as he would have wished to
die, a soldier’s death. He was a soldier in his youth and became a
soldier in his prime, and died for Queen and country. They were all
proud of Lumsden’s Horse and of Colonel Showers, who died at the head
of his men in the first battle in which they were engaged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>From these extracts, and especially from the episode in which
Dr. Powell played such a gallant part, we may know that the
Surma Valley Light Horse were worthy of the Colonel who had
volunteered to serve in a subordinate capacity that he might be
with them in their first campaign and whose memory they still
revere. That all Assam may bear in mind how he had endeared
himself to those who served with him, the men of that corps have
caused a handsome monument to be wrought in red Aberdeen
granite for erection in the country where they first enlisted as
Volunteers under his command. Its gabled base forms a Gothic
cross surmounted by an octagonal spire, and in one panel under
a cusped arch is the following inscription:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Before this monument was shipped from Glasgow to
Calcutta in September 1902 a sketch of it was sent by
Mr. Peters, who had taken charge of all arrangements, to
Lord Roberts. In acknowledgment the Commander-in-Chief
wrote:</p>

<p class='c000'>It was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>esprit de corps</em></span>, as Colonel Lumsden expressed it in

sentiment from which mutual confidence springs:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c019'>Spytfontein, May 1.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dear Colonel Rendell</span>,—I am writing to give you an account of
the first action the gun has been in, and to tell you how admirably the
men behaved in what were really very trying circumstances. When we
left Calcutta I had the gun arranged to go on pack saddles on horses;
but when we arrived here we found this would not do, as our animals
were not properly trained, and in jumping about they were always
knocking pieces of skin off and otherwise damaging themselves. We
therefore fitted up one of our transport carts as a carriage, and with two
mules as wheelers and four horses in front we get along pretty well.
The first day we went out to fight we saw nothing, although there was
a little firing about two miles from us. On the way we came to a very
nasty piece of ground, and we succeeded in turning the gun head over
heels down the side of a kopje. By a miracle it was not injured in the
least, and I felt sure it must be going to do some work. Yesterday we
went out again, and had only gone about four miles when firing began all
along the line. We were on the right, next to a pom-pom; the Boer guns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>very soon found out the latter, and it had to be moved out of action. In
the meanwhile I had been having a go at the Boer gunners at about 3,000
yards. No sooner had the pom-pom gone than a shell missed my head
by about a foot, fell twenty yards behind me and burst, wounding four of
my horses slightly. This wasn’t quite good enough and I got out of
action as soon as I could, but not before they had sent two more shells
right among us, or too close to be pleasant; the last one killed two
horses and blew a trooper’s foot to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Boers outnumbered us by about four to one, and shortly after this
we received an order to retire with the rest, which we did. We had gone
about half a mile, with rifle bullets sprinkling around us, when I was
ordered to come into action behind a few stones that were lying on the
plain. There wasn’t an atom of cover for my horses or the men holding
them, although the gun was partly protected. I opened fire on the Boers
at 1,000 yards, had fired about 250 rounds of rapid traversing fire when
they began to retire. I fired about another 230, when the gun jammed,
and at the same moment an officer came dashing up to tell me to retire
immediately. We did so under a perfect hail of bullets, and although
I had six horses wounded out of ten, not one of them was so badly
injured as to be unable to go on, and not a single man of us was touched.
After going about half a mile I gave my horse to Corbett to lead, and got
into the cart and managed to get the gun into action again. We lost
three belts and boxes in our hasty retirement, but that of course could
not be helped. The men with me were Sergeant Bale, of Jubbulpur;
Private Booth, of Howrah; Privates Dowd, Dickens, Corbett, and Burnand,
of Jamalpur; and Private Bolst, of Asonsole; Private Burnand is my
driver. There was one other man of Lumsden’s Horse with me, named
Mercer, who was helping to hold horses. Sergeant Dale, Privates Booth,
Corbett, and Bolst, and myself were on the gun. Colonel Ross, who was
in charge of our brigade, expressed pleasure at the work done by the gun,
and said that we knocked over several of the enemy, which was distinctly
satisfactory. Our casualties were heavy. We lost our Second-in-Command
(Major Showers) killed, Lieutenant Crane missing and wounded, and one
private known to be killed, and probably one or two others of the wounded
have since died, our killed, wounded, and missing being seventeen in all.</p>

<p class='c000'>How our team escaped injury is to me little short of a miracle. The
men behaved splendidly, and if ever we get into as tight a place again
I have perfect confidence in their standing by me and the gun. Our
ambulance is out now looking for wounded, but the Boers have probably
attended to them long ago—at any rate, I hope so. Our men have
certainly had their baptism of fire, and I for one should not object if we
never got it as hot again.</p>

<p class='c000'>You would hardly recognise the gun now, I fancy; it is a dirty khaki
colour, with the paint knocked off it in, places and smothered with dirt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and stuff outside. But the inside is, I think, quite as clean as when at
Jamalpur; anyhow, it still knows how to work.</p>
<div class='c021'>Yours very sincerely,</div>
<div class='c019'><span class='sc'>B.W. Holmes</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>From the personal experiences of a non-commissioned officer
who was wounded and captured by the Boers we get side-lights
that help more than anything else towards a clear understanding
of the temper and actions of men on the battlefield. To some
extent this story touches on ground that has already been covered
by previous descriptions. Partly for that reason, but mainly
because it is a complete picture of one incident the nobility of
which would have been lost if woven into the continuous
narrative, it has been kept distinct, so that the writer’s
impressions may be reproduced here with all the minor touches
and bits of local colour that made them vivid at the time of
occurrence. He begins with the march out of camp at 3 o’clock
that memorable morning:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We fell in punctually and moved off to the rendezvous, the moon
shining brightly and making wonderful black shadows among the
surrounding kopjes-pronounced ‘koppies,’ by the way. The cold was
intense, and numbed our fingers so that our reins could scarce be felt;
The order to trot was received with satisfaction, for we were all
shivering, men and horses alike. A few minutes later we joined
company with a pom-pom battery of two guns, and a body of Mounted
Infantry composed of Australians and details from various regiments.
Our strength in all was, we have since heard, some 800, while the
opposing Boers numbered three or four thousand, with several big guns.
When our little band was complete, the order was given to trot, and
we proceeded at a sharp pace for about a mile. Daylight was then
breaking and a halt was called, the order being given to dismount and
charge magazines—a sign of business received with much satisfaction.
Thereafter we moved forward in extended order, with scouts in advance
for three or four miles, when stray shots in front showed us that we were
coming into touch with the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before us the country lay in ridges running parallel with each other,
and at right angles to our line of advance. As we surmounted each
rising we expected to view the enemy, but the order to dismount came
without our being vouchsafed any visible sign of their presence. Before us
lay some 800 yards of rising ground, and we swarmed up in a long open
line, fully expecting a volley ere we reached the top. However, our hour
of trial had not yet come, though the scattered shots heard to our front
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>as we advanced had increased to a sharp fusillade on our left front. The
order then came to extend away into a narrow valley running at right
angles and crossing the ends of the succession of ridges we had covered.
Thus, lying on the slope, we could see behind for a mile or so, and in the
opposite direction, up the valley, right into the country which the enemy
were known to occupy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly afterwards the music began in earnest. A mile up the valley
a Boer big gun appeared and opened fire on troops advancing on
the hill from our left rear. Then out came one of our pom-poms
and, galloping into position, replied from the opposite end of the valley at
a range of some 3,000 yards. The duel between the two lasted for
about ten minutes, the pom-pom firing briskly as is its wont, the more
ponderous Boer gun replying every two minutes. Lying on the slope as
we were, in full view of the valley and within a hundred yards of the line
of fire of the opposing guns, we had a splendid, not to say realistic,
illustration of artillery fire. The singing of the big shells as they tore
through the air was magnificent to our unaccustomed ears. It was
curious, too, to observe the sequence in which indications of discharge and
report reached us. The first sign that the Boer big gun had been fired
was the little cloud of smoke floating near the muzzle. Next we heard
the singing of the shell passing up the valley. This was followed by the
dust raised by the explosion of the shell in bursting, and not until
these evidences of a shot having been fired did we hear the actual
report, which was closely followed by that of the bursting shell itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some five minutes the duel proceeded, no evidence of the effect
of the pom-pom fire being visible to our eyes, though it became evident
that the Boers were finding the range, for each shell seemed to land
nearer, until, as it seemed to us, one burst right in the middle of our gun.
At that moment those of us on the slope heard rifle fire immediately behind.
It proved to be our own regiment’s Maxim taking sighting shots at the
Boer gun. This certainly made things livelier, but there was no comfort
in realising that we lay right in the line of fire, and that replies from the
enemy would probably land among us. However, the Boers took no
notice of the Maxim, though it spat out bullets at a tremendous rate,
but continued to devote their attention to the pom-pom. The greater
weight of the Boer metal soon made matters too hot for Captain Rotton’s<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
little gun, and it shortly afterwards retired behind the hill, having lost
several horses. Then our turn came, and the officious little Maxim,
which had been kicking up a great shindy in our rear, drew the Boer fire.
The first shot whizzed unpleasantly close to our heads and burst between
us and the Maxim, which, undismayed, continued to pour out a hot fire.
Number two was aimed slightly higher and travelled beyond the gun, killing
two horses and wounding one man. The Maxim stuck it out pluckily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>for one more shell, but that fell so close that to have delayed any longer
would have only been folly. On the retreat of our machine gun the
Boer gun retired behind a kopje, and we were left in peace for a time,
though the firing on our left had now greatly increased, and showed that
a brisk fight was going on.</p>

<p class='c000'>About 10 o’clock orders were received for part of my section to extend
to the right, and six of us, in command of Sergeant Walter Walker, went
right down into the valley. In our new position we were sheltered by a
low rocky ridge on the left, but the ground was open in every other
direction. The ridge referred to cut us off entirely from what was going
on on our left, and this accounts for the misfortunes which followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the firing that had begun on our left earlier in the morning
had increased tremendously. Bullets began to come our way very
frequently, but as we were under the lee of a ridge they passed over our
heads, evidently nearly spent, for the sharp ping of a newly-sped shot had
changed with them into the melancholy wail of spirits that had lived and
lived in vain. So great had the noise become that shouting to each other
was ineffectual, not a word reaching even one’s next neighbour. So we
lay and waited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly it struck us that the chain of fire extending in a line to our
left seemed to be swinging towards our left rear, and a few minutes’ attention
confirmed an idea that the position of the opposing forces must have
altered considerably. As we listened the firing seemed to increase in
fierceness and sounded still further to the rear. The position had become
uncomfortable, for our horses were 800 yards in our direct rear. To
lose them would be fatal to our safety; the six of us, therefore, got up
and began to retire slowly, wondering that no orders had reached us.</p>

<div id='i187_1'  class='figright id015'>
<img src='images/i_b_187_1.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>BUGLER R.H. MACKENZIE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A shower of bullets swept past, singing in our ears with spiteful
distinctness. Looking round I saw, barely fifty yards away, two-score
Boers kneeling and firing away for all they were worth. A second look
was unnecessary, and we ran like deer, the bullets whizzing by thick as hail.
It was amazing that none of us was hit. Bullets seemed to me to be
pouring between my legs and under my feet. A little rising gave us
momentary protection, but the Boers came on again until within fifty
yards, and poured a hot fire into us. Two hundred yards away we could
see our horses and near them the rest of the section, which had got
earlier notice of the repulse of our troops, galloping away. Each man
got to his horse, but they shouted to me that mine had been killed by a
shell. It was not a pleasant predicament, but before I had time to
realise that the Boers must either shoot or capture me, Bugler Mackenzie
galloped up and offered me a lift behind him. I was dead beat with
running and quite unequal to violent effort. I put my foot in the
stirrup he released, and tried to climb up. But my bandolier, haversack,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and water-bottle all bunched in front and caught the blanket tied on at
the pommel of the high military saddle. Back I flopped on to the ground.
Another effort, and I nearly pulled Mackenzie,
who was a light boy, out of the saddle. The
firing all the time was very hot, and, fearing to
bring disaster on all of us, I ordered Mackenzie
off. But he would not budge until Saunders and
Parkes between them helped me up behind the
first-named. What a relief it was to feel the
ground slipping past and to know we were getting
out of such a desperate scrape! The Boer fire
had slackened for a little, but the reason was
that they had mounted and galloped up to within
close range. Again they opened, and once more
the ground all around was dusted up and the air
alive with singing bullets. It was too much to
hope for escape a second time, and sure enough,
before we had gone a hundred yards, the gallant gee with his double
load fell heavily to earth, a bullet having struck him. Being perched
high up, I reached the ground first with a thud I hope never to experience
again. Saunders then fell on top of me, and the horse crashed heavily
across both of us, kicking me on the shoulder as he rolled over.</p>

<p>E.B. PARKES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I must have been stunned for a moment, but soon recovered my
senses and realised that I had broken nothing nor been hit by a bullet.
Saunders lay very still within ten feet of me, and I feared he was dead.
But cautious inquiry elicited a reply. He was all right, but complained
of being unable to move one arm, and we assumed it was broken. All
this time the firing continued, evidently directed at our retreating section.
Judge of my astonishment, on looking up to see
why it should suddenly have increased in our
immediate neighbourhood, to observe Parkes riding
back to us. He had pulled up as quickly as he
could when he noticed our disaster. Seeing
Saunders lying quiet, he offered to take me on his
horse, but I shouted to him to clear off, as he
was endangering his own life as well as drawing
the fire on us. I could not have left Saunders
after his having stopped to take me up, and for
Parkes and myself to have helped him away in the
midst of such a murderous fire would have been
folly. Very reluctantly Parkes galloped off. His horse shortly afterwards
was shot under him, but he managed to get away by running. As for
myself, I was so shaken I could not have gone far on foot, besides which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>I was already exhausted by running. In any case, to have got up and
attempted escape with the enemy in such force and at such close range
would have been madness. I accordingly lay very still and called to
Saunders to do likewise. Immediately afterwards a party of Boers some
300 strong swept past us on horseback, evidently in pursuit of our retiring
troops, and then began a very trying part of our experience. The Boers
were some hundreds of yards in front lying on the face of a slope, and we
got the full benefit of a very hot fire directed against them. Three shells
from our own guns burst all around, and the fire of a pom-pom sighted a
little too high tore up the ground close on our left. Bullets fell all
around us and between us; so embarrassing was the situation that I
began to look about for cover. But turning round I saw a Boer some
hundred yards away steadily looking at us from under the lee of a rock.
Whenever he saw me turn he dropped on to his knee and levelled his
rifle. Quickly I lay like one dead, and whispered hoarsely to Saunders not
to move for his life. It was an anxious wait. No bullet came, and the
Boer, seeing us remain still, stole cautiously up to where he could see our
faces. Realising we were helpless, he dropped his rifle and came up,
assuring us he would not harm us. He rolled Saunders round, took a
valuable set of glasses from him, as well as belt, purse, knife, water-bottle,
and everything worth having. He was about to commence operations on
me, and I was wondering if it would be worth while to make a dash for
his rifle, when he got up and cleared off. The cause was the approach
of a Boer doctor, who came up and most kindly inquired if we were
wounded. Finding nothing seriously the matter with us, he explained
that he must move on to more dangerous cases, but promised to come
back and attend to us later on. Then a large party of Boers suddenly
surrounded us. They stripped me of my belt, to which was attached a
fine knife and a good compass; also bandolier, ammunition, and water-bottle,
the latter evidently a much appreciated prize. I begged to have
my knife back, as it was a present from a dear friend. To my astonishment,
it was handed back to me. Then one offered to buy it, but was
quashed by the others, who said it was a shame to want from me what I
valued so much. Then we were helped up and marched off towards the
ambulance, Saunders suffering considerably from his arm, I feeling sound
enough but very sick and giddy. Round the ambulance cart was a large
crowd of Boers, evidently enjoying the shelter of the Red Cross. They
looked curiously at us, and the bolder asked for our spurs and badges.
We parted with these, but protested at a request to give up our leathern
gaiters. A doctor bound up Saunders’s arm, and we were sent off in charge
of three guards to the Boer laager which lay over the hill to the north.
After a bit one of the Boers, observing me to move very groggily, put me
on his horse. But Saunders, though his arm pained him a good deal, had
to walk.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>In their first fight, and on many occasions afterwards,
Lumsden’s Horse bore testimony to the sportsmanlike qualities
and humanity of their enemies, especially towards men who were
lying wounded and helpless on the field. Writing many months
afterwards, Colonel Lumsden gave some affecting instances by way
of illustration, and several of these were connected with the affair
at Houtnek, though their interesting sequels were not known in
some cases until near the close of the campaign. These may
be given in Colonel Lumsden’s words. He writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>‘One touch of Nature makes the whole world kin.’ Many kindly
actions on the part of the Boers have gone unrecorded in the present
campaign. I cannot, however, allow one or two which came under my
special notice to pass without mention.</p>

<p class='c000'>On April 30, 1900, when we were engaged with that clever General
De la Rey, my scouts, while <a id='corr189.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='reconnoitiring'>reconnoitring</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_189.15'><ins class='correction' title='reconnoitiring'>reconnoitring</ins></a></span> under Lieutenant Pugh,
far in advance of the main body, came suddenly upon a well-concealed
Boer outpost, who opened fire on them, wounding poor Franks severely.
Pugh stuck to him gallantly, making for where he considered our leading
column would be. Franks, however, got so weak that Lieutenant Pugh
and the other two scouts had to dismount him and leave him on the
veldt. Later in the day, when the enemy’s fire slackened, some friends of
Franks were able to go out and carry him in and place him in the hands
of Dr. Powell, who did all that was possible for him in the circumstances.
We were holding an untenable position, and when the order came to
retire early in the afternoon, poor Franks had to be left until an ambulance
might be got to carry him back to our headquarters camp at Spytfontein.
Shortly after our retirement from the spot where he lay the Boers
occupied the ground we had left, and, finding Franks, treated him with
every kindness and attention. It was the last we saw of him. Some
five days later, at the fight near Brandfort, a Boer ambulance containing
several wounded Boers and with Doctor Everard in charge fell into our
hands. On my riding up to interview the latter, he asked if we were not
Lumsden’s Horse, and on my replying in the affirmative he said, ‘One of
your men, named Franks, fell into our hands on April 30, and was under
my care. I did all I could for him, but the poor fellow died.’ Then producing
a small note-book from his pocket he said, ‘In this I have noted
when and where he was buried. I also found on his person two sovereigns
and two rings.’ These the doctor handed to me with a request that I
would be good enough to forward them to the boy’s mother. I thanked
him most gratefully for what he had done on behalf of my late comrade,
and in due course was able to forward, through Trooper Preston, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>relics handed to me to Mrs. Franks, of The Chase, Clapham Common,
London.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same day (April 30), Lieutenant Crane, with a small detachment
of my corps, was sent by Colonel Ross, our commanding officer, to
occupy a low-lying kopje on our left front. They were attacked by an
overwhelming number of the enemy, and nearly the whole of the little lot
were either killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, as they maintained their
position to the last. Lieutenant Crane himself, being badly shot in the
groin, was lying in an exposed position unseen by us, and under fire of our
own Maxim gun, which was playing on the kopje now occupied by the
Boers, and in imminent risk of being killed by our own fire. Suddenly one
of the Boers came forward amidst a hail of bullets, lifted up Lieutenant
Crane, and carried him to a place of safety. Many a V.C. has been
gained by doing a similar action. This story was subsequently corroborated
by Lieutenant Crane, who told me that the man who behaved so
gallantly towards him was named Meyers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange to relate, in the following September when that ideal Cavalry
leader, General French, made his brilliant dash on Barberton—a feature of
the campaign on which I think too little has been said, and not sufficient
credit given to the leadership and pluck of the gallant General—Lumsden’s
Horse comprised his rearguard, under the command of General Mahon, of
Mafeking fame. As we rode up the heights prior to following General
French’s force into the Barberton Valley, we came across several Boer
families living in tents and grazing their cattle on the veldt. I rode up
to one of the tents and was chatting with a stalwart Boer and his family.
He immediately spotted what corps we were and said, ‘Oh, we fought
against you at Houtnek.’ I asked his name, and he said Meyers. I then
shook hands with him gratefully and said, ‘You are the man who carried
my subaltern, Crane, at the risk of your life into a place of safety on that
day.’ He brought me a cup of coffee, and while I was chatting pleasantly
with his wife and family he said, ‘Have you got a man with you of the
name of McGillivray? I remember him well, a big Scotchman. We
took him prisoner that day, and on our way to Pretoria I had the pleasure
of dividing a couple of bottles of whisky between him and one or two of
his comrades also in our hands.’ As this Boer was living quietly on the
veldt, and not in the fighting line, I had the pleasure of getting a pass for
himself and his family by way of showing some practical gratitude for his
kind and plucky treatment of my comrades.</p>

  <h2 id='chap10' class='c005'>CHAPTER X <br /> <span class='small'><em>PRISONERS OF WAR</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To be carried off captive after the first hot skirmish into which
one has gone full of confidence and hope is a trying experience
for any soldier, and especially for those who are conscious of
having done manful deeds deserving a better fate. In these
circumstances, however, it implies no humiliation, but only a
feeling of rebellious resentment against the fortunes of war that
have, at one fell stroke, swept away all hopes of further distinction,
dashed every ambitious plan, and severed for a time at
least all pleasant associations with comrades whose friendship is
never so truly appreciated under other conditions as it is amid the
rough campaigning experiences that try the temper and the
mettle of all men. The full sense of everything that has been lost
comes upon war-prisoners in the first hours of their captivity with
the crushing force of a hopeless defeat, so that they cannot even
find it in their hearts to be thankful for the lives that have been
spared to them. If this is so in the case of men to whom loss of
liberty means no reproach and who have the proud consciousness
that they did not purchase safety by unfaithfulness to their trust,
how much sharper must the sting be to those who by pusillanimous
surrender have brought the dark shadow of dishonour
on themselves and stained the proud blazonry of regimental
distinctions! Happily, British soldiers have not often gone
into captivity with that stigma resting on them; and, though
critics at home were ungenerously prone to assume that the ‘flag
of shame’ had been hoisted too readily in some fights against
the Boers, they would have told a different story if it had
been their lot to lie on the bare veldt within rifle-range of hidden
enemies under whose deadly fire it is even more dangerous to go
back than to go forward. The idea of wresting victory by a rush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>or wriggling up to it through zone after zone of hailing bullets
across four or five hundred yards of open ground could only have
commended itself to tacticians comfortably ensconced in arm-chairs
far from the buzz and boom of war. Hemmed in by a
girdle of fire that cannot possibly be broken by a charge across
such distances, men must either lie down like sheep to be
slaughtered, or walk to their deaths with eyes open, making
useless sacrifices, or surrender; and none but a braggart who
had never been under fire would dare to hurl the poisoned arrows
of reproach at brave men upon whom the last alternative has
been forced. Every soldier knows how unjust is that journalistic
phrase ‘an easy surrender.’ Nobody could have written it if
he had thought for a <a id='corr192.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='monent'>moment</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_192.13'><ins class='correction' title='monent'>moment</ins></a></span> of the bitterness that is in the
hearts of men who have to yield under the white flag; yet it is
not necessarily an emblem of shame for all that. Lumsden’s
Horse did not hoist it in their direst extremity, but they would be
the last to jeer at men who have passed through such an ordeal.
If ever captives had the right to hold up their heads in the presence
of triumphant enemies, those men were the troopers of Lumsden’s
Horse who had sacrificed themselves rather than abandon a
wounded comrade. One of them, Corporal Firth, a prisoner in
the hands of the Boers, wrote to his parents from Waterval on
May 7, 1900:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>You will by this time have seen that I am now a prisoner of war
from the published lists in the papers. I will just give you an outline of
what happened on the 30th ult. An officer, two non-commissioned
officers, and eleven men were told off to hold a hill as a guard against an
attack on the right of a body advancing from our centre; this centre body
had to retire, and we, receiving no orders, held on as long as possible
until forced to retire, which we did, having five killed, our officer wounded,
and four taken prisoners, leaving only four who escaped to tell the
tale. I could have got away, only went back to the assistance of our
officer, who was wounded about ten yards behind me. I bound him up
under a heavy fire, and Providence must have watched over me that day,
as bullets in hundreds were flying all round me. I am in good health and
received very kind treatment from the hands of my captors, of which I
will write more on another occasion, as I am not yet settled down in my
new surroundings.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>How he and his fellow-prisoners fared after they had fallen
into the power of their enemies is a story told with graphic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>picturesqueness in the following letters from Sergeant Fraser,
who was surrounded by Boers when he lay bruised by a heavy
fall in company with Trooper Saunders, who had gallantly risked
his own life in an attempt to bring Fraser out from under fire:</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Johnston and Hoffmann.</em></span><br />SERGEANT DAVID S. FRASER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We had imagined that our destination was comparatively close, but
we covered mile after mile without any more satisfaction from our guards
than that it was over the next kopje. The column wound in and out among
many hills ere a halt was called. Though we had started about 11 in
the morning, it was not until 4 o’clock in the afternoon that our escort
stopped at an ambulance tent, which was in charge of a hospitable Swiss
doctor. We had had nothing to eat all day. In the hurry of getting
ready so early in the morning neither
of us had time to think of food, and
our day’s rations were in our saddles,
now in the hands of the Boers. So the
good Swiss fed us plentifully with
soup, meat, and coffee. He examined
me and found only bruises. Saunders’s
arm was much swollen, and the surgeon
could not ascertain what the damage
was. It afterwards turned out that the
muscles were lacerated and one of the
bones in the forearm cracked.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the doctor’s tent was a wounded
officer, Lieutenant and Adjutant Lilley,
of the Victorian Mounted Rifles. He,
poor chap, had been shot through the
head during the same engagement, and
had been brought in a waggon from the
field. He recognised us in so far as to
repeat the name of our regiment, but
seemed woefully wounded and repeatedly
broke out in delirium. The doctor who had been so kind to us seemed
assiduous in his attentions, and I am sure everything possible was done
for the poor Australian. We heard afterwards that he had been left in
hospital at Brandfort by the Boers, and found by our troops a few days
afterwards, when they took possession of that place. He subsequently
died from the wound, which was caused by a bullet passing through his
brain. Marching for another mile we came to the Boer laager at dusk.
Those in camp met us kindly, more particularly as the news given by our
guards was that their own commando had apparently scored a victory.
They gave us coffee at once, and a place to lie down and rest. And thus
began our captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>While Saunders and myself were recovering from our exertions,
discussing the events of the day, and generally commiserating each other
upon our misfortunes, we were much cheered to perceive the approach of
two men attired in khaki and helmets. These proved to be Sergeant-Major
Healy, of the Victorian Rifles, and Private Simmons, of the Duke
of Cornwall’s Regiment’s Mounted Infantry. Both had fearful things to
relate of the morning’s action. They had been through all the heavy
fighting preceding the occupation of Bloemfontein, and agreed that never
had they experienced such hot fire as on this particular morning. About
8 o’clock our guards supplied us with bread and coffee, and pieces of
biltong, stuck on a wire, that had been thrust into a fire. They then
accommodated us with a tent, a blanket apiece, and an empty sack or
two—for we had no coats, and the cold was intense. In such comfort
as we could make for ourselves with these limited resources we lay down,
and soon slept the sleep of the weary. It seemed but a few minutes
since we had turned in when we were awakened with rough kindliness,
and turned out of our tent. The bulk of the commando had returned
to camp after a successful but wearisome day, and the owners of the
tent wanted their own. So out we got into the bitter cold. They
placed us between two tents, and we arranged ourselves a second time
as best we could. Despite the lack of warmth and comfort, we slept
heavily, and the sun was high in the heavens next morning ere we
awoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bread and coffee formed our breakfast, and this meagre meal was
welcome enough. Our guards themselves had no more, so we could
not complain. As the morning wore on, the sun became rather trying,
and once again we were accommodated with a tent, wherein we discussed
at length the events of yesterday. As this conversation turned
inevitably to our own capture, needless to say we gradually began to
despond. But we were shortly to have our hearts lightened by the
discovery of fellow sufferers—how company in trouble eases one! In
marched Firth, McGillivray, Macdonald, Petersen, and Williams, of our
own corps, followed by Coghlan, of Sergeant-Major Healy’s regiment.
Coghlan had a broken leg, done up in plaster of Paris, and lay on an
ambulance pallet. Needless to say, we had much to tell each other,
and Saunders and myself then heard how Franks, Case, Daubney, and
H.C. Lumsden had been killed, and Lieutenant Crane wounded and
a prisoner. It was not until afterwards we heard that Major Showers
had been killed and several others wounded on the same day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frugal fare of the morning was repeated in the afternoon, except
in the case of the bread. Of it the Boers had none, but they furnished
us with a plentiful supply of a kind of rusk. This appeared to be simply
broken bread dried in an oven. It made a very good meal, but tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>those of us whose teeth had been somewhat worn down by eating
<em>moorghis</em><a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> in India.</p>

<p class='c000'>To march forth in the morning with a gun in your hand to fight your
country’s battles; to endanger your life that you may return to your
female relatives, decorated and a hero; to hear the vicious ping of bullets,
the shrieking of shells, and know yourself alarmed but undismayed, are
fine things. But to sit at night in the enemy’s laager with wings clipped,
no gun, and a sinking stomach is so untoward a thing that a man who
suffers it may well question the reason of his birth and entertain hopes
that the world is about to end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Six of us sat in the dusky light of a tent in a Boer laager near Brandfort,
and our own mothers could not have comforted us. It wasn’t as if
we had had a bellyful of fighting, like others who had begun the campaign
in Cape Colony, or as if after a tremendous struggle we had been overpowered.
Without practically a chance to retaliate, we had been deluged
with bullets that went by in such numbers you could hear them rattle
against each other in their flight. Then instead of the bullets came the
Boers, and we were prisoners—hands up, pockets empty, hopes vanished!—this
in our first fight!</p>

<p class='c000'>When night had fallen, the sentries—there were two of them, with
loaded rifles and revolvers—passed us in a big kettle in which had been
boiled water and, they said, coffee.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of us sadly asked if they had put in sugar as well, and on receiving
a reply in the affirmative, murmured, ‘What good hot water!’ Then we
munched away at rusks, of which light and tasteless provender they
chucked us in a quantity in the bottom of a sack, and I wondered if the
nourishment contained therein would compensate for the energy expended
in chewing them. I know I registered a mental vow never to feed my
horses on bran alone if ever I got back to India. A few of us had pipes,
and there was no difficulty about Boer tobacco; but here, again, one was
reminded of bran, for although the colour was not quite the same the
taste was nearly identical with what I imagine bran would give if smoked.
As it grew late the cold increased, and by 9 o’clock we were shivering.
Those of us who had managed to retain their greatcoats were not so
badly off, but others, who had nothing but thin khaki tunics, suffered
considerably. On representing matters to the sentries, they procured for
us a few blankets and empty sacks, and, huddled together, each man
endeavoured to sleep to the chatter of his neighbour’s teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The laager next morning showed signs of great activity. A large
patrol was about to start in the direction of the British lines, and the
two hundred or so composing this body shook hands, every man of them,
with half a dozen of their comrades, who, it afterwards turned out, were
to form our escort to Pretoria. According to our preconceived ideas of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>how troops should move out of camp the behaviour of the Boers seemed
absurd. No word of command appeared to be given, but in a moment
the aspect of the camp that had been full of men lolling about, talking
and skylarking, was changed. Horses were saddled, bridled, and mounted
in a matter of seconds, the ceremony of hand-shaking gone through, and
in less than five minutes from the first impulse which set them getting
ready the patrol had disappeared over the skyline. Some were trotting,
some cantering, and there was no attempt at formation; but none the
less their method, or want of it, was effective, and one could not help
being impressed with the individual independence of each man, combined,
as it was, with complete unanimity of object in the whole body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our turn came next, and we made our little preparations to start.
These consisted mostly of buttoning up, and, indeed, there was a charming
sense of irresponsibility in having no arrangements to make, no packing to
do, no <em>hookums</em><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> to give. For our conveyance was prepared a buck-waggon,
with the appearance of which the illustrated papers have made all the
world familiar. Twelve mules were stuck in front, the driver cracked his
whip, and the caravan was ready. Down the centre of the waggon, on a
mattress, and propped about with rolled-up blankets, was placed the
wounded Victorian. The rest of us sat round, with our legs dangling
over the side. A Kaffir held the reins from a raised seat in front, and two
Boers sat alongside of him with loaded rifles on their knees. But they
had their backs to the mules and the points of their guns towards poor
us. At the tail end of the waggon sat two more Boers, also armed. A
fifth Boer, unarmed, barring a whip as long as Chowringhi, marched
alongside to curse the mules and pick holes in their hides when the
cursing failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we stood ready the Boers near shook hands all round with us,
hoped the war would soon be over and we be back in our ain countrees
and themselves restored to the bosoms of their families. We moved off
with a jolt that made the poor Victorian groan, and they shouted good-byes
after us and congratulations that we were going to that wonderful place
Pretoria. Soon a rising hid the laager, and around we could see nothing
but veldt—not a tree, not a house, not a Boer. And now, we thought, is
our chance. We only had to lay hold of our guards by the throats, wrest
their rifles away, and so turn the tables completely—a poor return for
their hearty kindness, but then we did not cherish the same feelings for
Pretoria that they did. These ideas of escape were rippling round cheerfully
but guardedly, when our hopes flopped to the ground, for over the
skyline came cantering a couple of Boers, and we soon found their business
was to trot behind. We might easily overpower the guards in the
waggon; but what profit would there be in that if one mounted man
galloped for assistance while the other kept watch on our movements?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Without the mounted men we might have bagged our guards and got
clear away, as no warning of our escape could then have reached the Boer
lines for at least twenty-four hours. But it was not to be, and we resigned
ourselves to the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>When there’s nothing to see, almost as much to eat, and the Devil’s
own pother to think about, travelling is wearisome. Add to these conditions
a place to sit upon as hard as the heart of Pharaoh and the ever-present
gun to keep you on it, and travelling becomes well-nigh unendurable.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it wasn’t for the antics of Brother Boer we should have succumbed
to jaundice, occasioned by nausea of the situation, or some other fell
disease. But the Boer brother, to beguile the tedium of the way, showed
us a thing or two in bullying, in quarrelling, and in shooting—the last
named, to our disappointment, not being a consequence of the first
two. Hanging on to a projection of our waggon was an attendant to
look after the mules, a Kaffir boy about fifteen years old. His face
was unadorned with beard, whisker, or moustache. One of the Boers
snatched the boy’s cap from him, held him tight by the scruff of the
neck, and then chucked the cap into the road. Meanwhile the waggon
proceeded, and soon the cap was a dim speck half a mile behind. Then the
owner of the cap was loosed off, and away he sped back to his lost property.
When he reached it we were a clear mile away. Thereupon the Boers
waxed mighty cheerful, and the waggoner, loudly chuckling, whipped up
his mules into a fast trot, the little nigger running like a good ’un far in the
rear. The going was too bad for continuous trotting, so in two or three
miles the boy had overhauled us, and, though very blown, he showed his
teeth with pleasure at catching us, apparently bearing no malice for the
trick that had been played on him. But his troubles were not over.
As he laid hold of the waggon to jump on, a great Boer hand was sprawled
in his face and he went down on the road like a thousand of bricks at the
unexpected assault. Loud guffaws from the brethren greeted this performance.
It was repeated again and again till the poor devil was hopelessly
beaten, and unable to continue the game. Then, when allowed to hang on
again, he had to put up with brutal horseplay. His ears were pulled, his
face contorted into extraordinary shapes, and tufts of wool, bleeding, jerked
out of his head. At this point we deemed it our business to interfere, and,
appealing to the man who appeared to be in command of our guard, and
who spoke English well, we asked if it was usual for the Boers to treat
Kaffirs in this way. And if so, we told him, it was high time every Boer in
South Africa was shut up in St. Helena. This touched him up, and he
ordered the two bullies to drop it. Then ensued a pretty quarrel. Some
of us felt sure there were Hindustani words used—and dreadful they
sounded in Dutch mouths. We fondly hoped there would be shooting, or
at least fisticuffs. But the Boer is like the Bengali—a leviathan in words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and a mouse in deeds. Behind a stone his heart is like that which
protects him, and in the open his heart becomes just like the atmosphere
which affords him no protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>When cheerfulness was more or less restored somebody espied a herd
of buck about a mile away. The keen sight of the Boers is astonishing,
and the way they detected the movements of the buck at that distance
was a revelation. Some of us could see nothing at all, but the keenest
thought they could spot a little bit of colour which the Boers said was a
herd of about twenty buck. In a minute three of them were blazing
away with their Mausers, but the herd cleared without casualty. Throughout
the rest of the way the Boers blazed away without intermission
at anything and everything that suggested itself as a target. There
certainly was no idea among them then that it would be well to husband
ammunition. I see by the papers that their commandants are said to be
exhorting the Boers now in the field to save their cartridges for officers,
and not to waste any on the Tommies, but at the date of which
I am writing they behaved as if their supply of ammunition was
inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c000'>About midday a halt was called, the niggers did something to the
harness, which dropped on the ground, and the mules, freed, were quickly
up to their knees in an adjacent dam, and soon after that busily engaged
with the veldt grass. Only once a day were they supposed to get a feed
of corn, and from all we could hear that day only came round about
once a week. In the meantime the Boers had fished out an empty wine
case, smashed it up, lighted a fire, and placed a great kettle on top. While
that was boiling the carcass of a sheep was produced from a sack, and all
and sundry hacked a piece off. When the kettle had boiled and the
coffee was made, the fire was heaped up afresh with wood, and every man
had his bit of meat on the end of a stick, held it in the flames, where it
fizzled and cracked and spurted as merrily as any steak on a grill in
London town. There was a dish of salt to dip into when you judged
the cooking complete. Our rusk sack was still partially filled, and wasn’t
the dam full of water within a few yards of us? ‘What more could the
—— Englishman want?’ said Brother Boer, as he lapped up all the coffee!
In the newspapers the Boer is made to speak of the <i>verdomde rooinek</i>, but
my experience of the Boer is that he prefers Tommy’s pet adjective before
all others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our rustic repast over, the Kaffirs began to collect the mules. This
they did not by running round them, but by sitting still and emitting
sounds into the tenor of which God forbid that any civilised human
being should inquire. Sufficient to say that they were weird enough to
‘kid’ the mules into leaving their feed and travelling half a mile to the
waggon, there to be yoked again in slavery. Thereafter our journey was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>uneventful until we struck the railway, where we fondly hoped to find a
train. But the advance of the British from Bloemfontein had begun, and
the Boers, to prevent a sudden descent on the railway within their own
lines, had taken the precaution of blowing up every bridge and culvert
for many miles inside their own outposts. So we had to traverse six
more weary miles, witnessing for diversion the destruction that dynamite
can bring upon the handiwork of man. Great iron bridges broken and
tossed aside, huge embankments shattered, railway stations annihilated.
Cruel signs, but the inevitable consequences of war. At dark we reached
Smaldeel, a little station sixty miles north of Bloemfontein, and at that
time the southernmost depôt of the Boer forces on the railway. Three
days later the British were in possession of Smaldeel and fired on the last
Boer train steaming out of the station. But knowing that afterwards did
not comfort us a bit when they locked us up that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Smaldeel is not an attractive place. We were dumped down in the
most unattractive part of it! Imagine a four-roomed house built of
wood and corrugated iron, one window per room and each one of them
nailed down, as it had been for a long time. Imagine in one of these
rooms Boer lumber—old clothes, empties, forgotten bedding; remember
the boarded window, call for a glass of brandy, and think with sympathy
of us poor sinners condemned to such a place for a livelong night.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a ghastly night it was! They passed us in a small kettleful
of coffee that ran to about half a mug per man. We were dreadfully
thirsty, but the only water was a single water-bottleful between the
crowd of us—they said there was no more available. For solids we had
the remains of the rusks. On this slender nourishment we had to recoup
our jaded bodies and revive our flagging spirits. Needless to say, in the
morning we looked and felt but sorry representatives of Queen and
country. At daylight we were cleared out of that room, the taste of
which will remain with me until the day I die. The effect on us of the
cold clean air outside was indescribable. We blew ourselves out with
it like pouter pigeons, and nearly dropped down from shock to the
system. We breathed the good air till we forgot to be hungry, thirsty,
or even ashamed of our lamentable plight. The surging of it through
our corrupted lungs was better than—but that would be departing from
the plain unvarnished style with which the soldier man is allowed to
embellish his narrative in lieu of literary grace.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were popped into a waiting train the carriages of which for
narrowness and hardness were like coffins without the compensating
immunity from pain and trouble so characteristic of the ordinary coffin.
That we might fit in easily they gave us nothing to eat or drink, and
when the train started we rattled about our compartment like dried
peas in a drum. To see us off the station was crowded with all sorts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and conditions of the human race. It was astonishing to realise that the
throat of man was so constituted that it could be used to emit sounds
which were nothing like anything we had ever heard before. I heard
a hundred High Court chaprassies hold the concert in which their
champion sang a solo in so raucous a voice that it caused the great
crack which now ornaments the Calcutta High Court building. But it
was nothing to Smaldeel station! Take a Boer who has lived on the
high veldt of the Transvaal with his next-door neighbour four miles off,
and bring him into a space where his conversation has to carry for feet
instead of miles, and you are overwhelmed by his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three hundred of that sort endeavoured to hold converse with us,
wanting to know where we had come from, why we had come, and what
we thought of our chances in the hereafter—no Boer thinks anybody
who has taken up arms against the Lord’s anointed people has a million-to-one
chance of salvation. We told them as much as we could, some of
it with regard to the truth, but mostly without. They plainly said we
were liars when we informed them we came from India. They knew all
about Indian coolies, so weren’t to be taken in. They were of opinion
that several of us who were clean-shaven were mere children, and
deplored the sinfulness of a Government that could send such lambs to
the slaughter. The clean-shaven ones cordially concurred, and ventured
to hope the Boer Government would do the right thing and ship the
little pets straight away to their mammas. That was another story, said
they—one that Oom Paul would know how to deal equitably with.
Pretoria! Pretoria! It was always Pretoria, as if that ghastly little
village was the hub of the universe.</p>

<p class='c000'>I may be allowed here to point out that the Dutch pronunciation of
the name of the late President of the Transvaal differs slightly from that
commonly used in India. Of course, our Indian way is the soundest,
but it may give this feeble narrative a touch of realism to have included
the fact that in South Africa ‘Kruger’ is pronounced ‘Cree-yer,’ with the
accent on the ‘Cree.’ ‘Paul’ is pronounced like ‘towel,’ with a ‘p’ instead
of a ‘t.’ The Burgher General Botha, in his native land, is called
‘Beau-ta,’ both syllables of equal value and spoken rather quickly—like
our Indian word ‘lotah,’ with which word, in fact, ‘Botha’ rhymes. Many
other words appertaining to South Africa are pronounced not at all in
the way that we have accepted as fit and proper. Swears, however, find
Boer and Briton unanimous both in pronunciation and frequency of use.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we had left the babel of Smaldeel far behind we settled down
to a critical examination of the country we were spinning through. We
had to occupy ourselves with a subject of absorbing interest so as to
divert our minds from dwelling on the vacuity of that part of our
anatomies which it is not considered polite to mention out of a church or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>a nursery. But in the matter of country—we found it consoling to see
nothing but rolling downs with never a kopje in sight, right or left,
nearly all the way through the northern part of the Free State. Surely
Bobs and his army would waltz along such easy going and speedily
rescue us from the clutches of the wicked Boer! So far as Kroonstad
there was nothing to stop the British. There a river forming a deep
spruit meandered by, and would certainly give trouble were our troops
to confine themselves to a frontal attack. But by this time the uses of
flanking movements had been thoroughly grasped by our army, and it
could only be a question of a day or two for our fellows to slip up on
either side and squeeze the enemy out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steaming into Kroonstad it was comforting to think what a favourable
country the British army would have to operate in, but the feeling was
as naught compared with that aroused in us when we heard we were to
be fed at Kroonstad. Psychologists evolve wonderful things from the
mind of the intellectual man. But let them starve him. Then see
how his inner consciousness changes its base of operations. Thoughts
emanating from the brain lack the vigour and inventiveness of those
prompted by the working of the more humble organ. The war in South
Africa proves this conclusively. Wherever our troops and Generals have
been well fed the tendency has been to make a mull of things. But
they have never been starved without doing grand work: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vide</em></span> the defence
of Ladysmith, the relief of Kimberley, the brilliant marches of Lord
Roberts’s army, where for days on end whole divisions had nothing but a
biscuit or two to crunch per man.</p>

<p class='c000'>We rushed into Kroonstad station with the familiar feeling of dashing
importance that everybody knows about who travels by rail. We pulled
up with the old jerk, only more so, that we so joyously used to anticipate
when children. We sniffed the refreshment-room, caught a glimpse
of the coloured papers in the bookstall, and everything seemed just the
same as in old England—as if we were only waking up to pleasant reality
after a horrid dream. But when we tried to get out the grimness of the
truth was brought home to us: loaded rifles barred our way.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, the grub came, and our sorrows were forgotten in the
pleasure of exercising our fast stiffening jaws. It was great sandwiches
of bully beef, no butter, no trimmings, but mighty good, and bowls of
steaming coffee. There was a fair whack for each man, and none of us
thought of giving half to the poor or saving up any for a rainy day.
Every man ate up all he got and never emitted a sound, other than that
of mastication, until the grunt of interrogation which denoted finished,
and was there any more? There wasn’t, and we got no more that day,
barring what we bought and paid for at extortionate rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any game in the world the Briton can beat the Boer if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>conditions are such that the Briton has any chance at all. This may
seem a reckless statement in view of the fact that 16,000 Boers are still
holding the field against ten times their number. But I make it with a
knowledge of the circumstances, and am willing to demonstrate the truth
of my statement to any unbeliever who has the pluck to call on me
expressing his doubt. At any rate, by night time, when we crossed the
Vaal River and had reached Vereeniging, the first station in the Transvaal,
we had so ‘kidded’ our guards into a belief in our desire to reach Pretoria
that they trusted us on to the platform, from which we gravitated into
the refreshment-bar with a celerity that would have astonished Sir Isaac
Newton. We found it crowded with people who didn’t seem to think we
were particularly remarkable—at any rate, they did not offer us drinks:
these we had to pay for at the rate of 2<em>s.</em> a peg—cheap enough, considering
everything. Hard-boiled eggs 6<em>d.</em> each, sandwiches 1<em>s.</em>, cigars none
under 1<em>s.</em> The last-named we could not run to, so set about looking for
pipes and ’bacca. Boer tobacco is sold in glazed paper bags, about the
size of 14 lb. of sugar, for 1<em>s.</em> a time. You can use it either for smoking
or as bedding for horses and cattle—they won’t eat it. Pipes like those
you get at home for 4½<em>d.</em> were half a crown, so there is no need to dissert
on the fiscal methods of the Boer: there’s no free trade about him. He
represents McKinley at about two stone in the matter of Protection. I
coveted a pipe for 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> and told the barman I was very sorry I only
had 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, and wouldn’t he give it to a poor broken-hearted prisoner
at a reduction? It was true about the 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, for I was afraid to produce
a sovereign lest some of them should take a fancy to it, as they had done
to so many of our little valuables. The beast said he’d see me damned
first, and I called him something in Hindustani which attracted more
attention than I liked, when I felt a hand twitching my tunic and saw
a little Jew man winking portentously. I put my hand down, and he
slipped a coin into it—a shilling it was, to enable me buy the pipe. This
is one of the few sporting things I have seen done in the Transvaal, and
it was not a Boer who did it. I don’t think Boers understand sport.
They never do anything until they have got six to four the best of their
neighbour. Every Boer who plays billiards carries a bit of soap, and the
few that are not afraid to play football are adepts at tripping. They
have stopped playing cards entirely, for they invariably found after a few
hands were dealt in a game that nothing but the rags of the pack
remained to be played with, all the good cards having gone up the
sleeves of the players.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, I bought the pipe, and refunded the kindly little Jew his
bob. Leaving the bar, I passed a little bunch of Boers who had rather
enjoyed my rebuff at the hands of the barman.</p>

<p class='c000'>I gravely congratulated the Boers on their brother behind the bar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>asked if they had many other Boers as good looking. Discretion may
sometimes be a branch of valour, but there was very little valour about
the discretion I exercised when I left that refreshment-bar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of the night in the train was tedious and uncomfortable to a
degree, and cold beyond words. At 3 or 4 in the morning we landed
at Pretoria, and our guards, all South African Republic Police—the
hated Z.A.R.P.—belonging to Pretoria, instead of leaving us in the
train until daylight, hauled us out and marched us off. After a mile or
so we came to a building. We entered by a gate, and found ourselves in
a courtyard with high walls. We were there delivered over to another
lot of ruffians, the first lot clearing off to their homes in high jubilation at
the prospect of rejoining wives and families after many months in the
field. They had not been unkind to us on the whole, and we found them
simple enough, but imbued with considerable contempt of the Britisher
and an unchangeable belief in the ultimate success of their own cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting on the cold stone pavement of the courtyard, chewing the cud of
our misfortunes, we waited for the only friend we’d got—the sun. Meanwhile
strange sounds came from the high walls surrounding us—heavy
sighs, deep gruntings, weird moanings, harsh cries, and loud beatings. We
wondered what manner of place we were in. Daylight revealed the truth.
We were in the Pretoria Gaol, and all around us were the drunks and
incapables, the vagrants and vagabonds, black and white, that had been
scraped out of the gutter the night before. Mostly they were Kaffir
women—huge, unwieldy, hideously ugly creatures, reminding one of those
depicted by Hogarth in his scenes of low life in London nearly two
centuries ago. When the sun rose the doors of the cells were opened and
we saw strange sights. The gaoler prodded the sulky ones with a long
stick and made them come out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Standing about in the fresh morning light, dirty, frowzled, altogether
abominable to look at, they seemed a blot on creation, and the knowledge
of their mere existence hung heavily on one’s mind. It was not a pleasant
awakening to the splendours of the Boer capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>For about the tenth time we gave in our full names, and all we could
think of in the way of description, down to red hair, for which the Boer
has a peculiar regard. A Boer with red hair can be a Mormon a dozen
times. Nearly all their clergymen have red hair. In among the drunks
and incapables we found one cell containing representatives of the British
Army, lately free fighting men, but now confined against their own
wishes. One of these, to my astonishment—for his appearance did not
suggest the soldier in the very least—addressed me by name, and I recognised
in him a saddler sergeant who had built me a very excellent saddle
some years before, when his regiment, the 18th Hussars, was in India.
He and a pal had been taken prisoners at the very beginning of the war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in Natal, and so had done six months in durance vile. They had been so
bored with their experiences that they had escaped and endeavoured to
get to Portuguese territory, but unluckily the ubiquitous Boer had been
too many for them, and they were now being restored to their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>status quo
ante</em></span>, as political paragraphists describe it. Another was a Yeoman lad
from county Notts, with a very much worn pair of boots to his feet, and
it showed fine public spirit in him that he seemed to deplore this fact
more than his being made prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the corner of the courtyard was a tap, and we all did a bit of washing.
The absence of silver-topped scent-bottles, ebony hair-brushes,
Pears’ soap, &amp;c., was rather a drawback, but it did not prevent us creating
at least a zone of cleanliness. We were then paraded, and in as martial
array as was possible, without guns or swords and incommoded with
blankets and empty sacks, we marched forth with a loud cheer. To be a
prisoner of war was a fate that might overcome the best soldier that ever
stepped, but to be herded with police mud-scrapings injured the dignity
of every one of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half-an-hour’s walk past cottages, bakers’ shops, where smiling lassies
stood at doorways, and all the signs of a little country town at home, we
came to a great enclosed space at one corner of which was inscribed the
legend ‘Polo Ground.’ We immediately began arguing about who was to
play in the first chukker, and whether we’d have a ten-minute chukker, with
a change of pony half-time, or chukkers of six minutes straight away.
Two known cracks were agreed upon, and they, to save unseemly fighting,
picked up sides. Then each side began backing itself for large sums (on
the nod), while the unselected ones scoffed and offered 5 to 4 against either
team. Needless to say, while diverting ourselves in this manner we were
girt about by armed horsemen, who conducted themselves with much
dignity and secret spurrings, especially when passing where comely
lassies stood at the doors. In this respect I have observed the Boer does
not differ from the Briton, nor has he any scruples about endeavouring to
attract the admiration of another Boer’s girl as well as his own. Marching
along one side of the enclosure, we came to a great entrance, and
realised of a sudden that we had arrived at the racecourse, rendered classic
by the experiences of our imprisoned troops within its gates. We entered
and found all the offices so familiar to racegoers—grand stand, paddock,
weighing-room, jockeys’ room, horse-boxes—but no equine wonders. It
filled our hearts with sorrow to see such waste—not even a booky to trill
forth the odds.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was a desolation over the scene very different from the stir
and bustle of a racecourse. Our troops had been penned up in a barbed-wire
enclosure that included the paddock, stands, and a bit of the course
itself. Most of the buildings had been utilised as hospitals, and where or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>how the poor devils who hadn’t enteric or dysentery or pleurisy or rheumatic
fever existed, Heaven alone knows. The N.C.O.s had the privilege of
sleeping on the steps of the grand stand, and I suppose the others had to
be content with the ground. Very quickly the accommodation at the racecourse
had become inadequate, and the camp at Waterval was established,
leaving only a hospital and a staff of orderlies. The result was a most woebegone
place, littered with empty tins, rags, paper, and refuse of all sorts.
We elected to occupy a row of horse-boxes facing the paddock. I’m sure
no owner of racehorses would have allowed any of his string to enter these
boxes, but we were only too glad to find a place wherein to lay our heads.
After a long delay they brought us rations of sorts—the potatoes, I remember
well, being little round things about the size of marbles and everyone
gaily sprouting. For the rest we had ½ lb. of meat and a loaf of bread
apiece, plenty of cold water, and the consolation of being told we had a
great deal to be thankful for. While our troops had been confined at the
racecourse some of the residents of Pretoria had been exceedingly kind in
supplying them with what, to them, were great luxuries to help out the
meagre fare allowed by the Boer Government. A much-appreciated but
sticky delicacy was a considerable supply of golden syrup. In one little
hut occupied by a mess of sergeants, twelve men used to sleep every night,
packed as close as herrings. The morning following the day on which
they had received their share of the golden syrup they found themselves
all stuck together, and had to rise up in one piece like a row of toy
soldiers.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Crane was taken off to the newly formed camp
for prisoners on a barren hillside north of Pretoria, where nearly
all officers had been confined within triple fences of barbed wire
since their removal from the Model School. Non-commissioned
officers and troopers of Lumsden’s Horse had to share the fate of
other captive soldiers at Waterval on the high veldt outside the
Magaliesberg, but luckily they were not among the number hurried
away by retreating Boer commandos to distant Nooitgedacht
when our troops entered Pretoria. At Waterval the daily
rations were scanty enough, though luxurious by comparison
with the meagre fare served out at a later date to prisoners in
that place away eastwards with a name that bespeaks desolation.
And by the kindness of the American Consul, Sergeant D.S.
Fraser was able to obtain funds from India for himself and his
fellow-sufferers. This enabled them to supplement the rough
rations issued to them during their imprisonment at Waterval.
To cover the advances made for this purpose Colonel Lumsden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>authorised a grant of 5<em>l.</em> each to the prisoners, being at the rate
of 1<em>l.</em> per man per week for the period of their captivity. Thus
the value of such a fund as had been raised in Calcutta before
the corps left was demonstrated in an unforeseen way. By means
of it Colonel Lumsden had been able to start with a treasure-chest
of 1,000<em>l.</em> and a sufficient credit in the Standard Bank of
South Africa to meet all emergencies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the uneventful dulness of their life in the prisoners’ camp,
where few visitors ever came, and none whose presence could
be considered very cheerful, we may judge by the fact that
hardly anything has been written about it. The poor fellows
who had neither money nor friends to procure it for them must
have fared ill indeed on nothing but Government rations issued
according to the following scale, which cannot be impugned,
seeing that the Editor found it written in choicest official
Dutch among other documents at Pretoria bearing the seal of
the Z.A.R. On this scale the officers were to receive 1 lb. of
meat and an undefined ration of meal, rice, or peas, per head
per day, with a weekly allowance of groceries amounting to 2 oz.
of coffee, 2 oz. of tea, and one candle per head. In practice the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>meat ration dwindled down at times to as little as 1½ lb. a week
for each officer, and the meal, rice, or peas being <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à discrétion</em></span>, not
of the consumer but of the burgher in charge, were occasionally off
the bill of fare altogether. The rank-and-file were each to receive
7 lb. of flour, 3 lb. of meal, 3 lb. of rice, 3 lb. of dried French beans,
21 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of salt, 3½ oz. of raw coffee beans, and 2 lbs. of
meat <em>per week</em>, and had to see that they got it, as the Boers, being
rather short of luxuries themselves, claimed the right to make
reductions frequently on the plea that there had been an
excessive issue for some previous day. Actually at one time the
prisoners at Nooitgedacht, to whom the same scale applied, did
not receive more than an average of 3 lb. of flour and ½ lb. of
meat per head per week, and the beans, which formed their only
vegetable diet, were useless. The captives among whom a few of
Lumsden’s Horse found their lot cast at Waterval were not so
badly off as that, but still there was so much monotony, both in
food and in the featureless routine of daily life, that they must
have been very glad to hear the booming of British guns outside
Pretoria and to know that the hour of their deliverance from
bondage was at hand. A few days after the entry of our
troops into the capital, Colonel Lumsden had the gratification
of writing:</p>

south of Thaba ’Nchu on May 1 that he regarded all the strategical
points in that direction as being securely held, and was therefore
no longer anxious for the safety of the railway, on which future
supplies for his army might be dependent after the exhaustion of
those already collected at Bloemfontein. In these circumstances
he determined on an immediate advance the day after Hamilton
had cut the Boer chain in two at Houtnek. He accordingly
sent General Pole-Carew’s division from Bloemfontein to Karree
Siding, where their arrival was hailed by Lumsden’s Horse as
significant of great things to follow, seeing that General Tucker’s
brigade had been pushed forward to occupy the ground over
which Mounted Infantry corps fought two days earlier. General
Hutton’s brigade of mounted troops was ten miles west of the
railway at Brakpan by Doorn Spruit, and General Ian Hamilton’s
division had advanced from Houtnek to Isabellafontein, out-flanking
the Brandfort range of kopjes. Thus, on the morning
of May 3 De la Rey found his position seriously menaced, and
after-events proved that he had no intention of making a stand
there longer than was necessary for a rearguard action, by which
he might delay the British advance and give his own main body
time to withdraw all heavy artillery and stores. Threatened on
the left by Ian Hamilton, and finding his right flank in danger
of being turned by Hutton’s Mounted Infantry, De la Rey
retired, and our troops entered Brandfort that afternoon. The
Boers, however, had fallen back to a second position, being
neither disorganised nor beaten, but only disinclined for close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>fighting, and until dusk they continued to show such a firm
front that the mounted troops could do little against them.
Colonel Lumsden sums up the situation briefly by the following
entry in his official diary:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the 3rd we left Spytfontein at daybreak with Colonel
Henry’s brigade, and joined General Maxwell’s brigade (14th) at the
foot of Gun Kopje, the place where Major Showers was killed. The
Mounted Infantry, covering a front of some three miles, swept the country
towards Brandfort, Infantry and guns following. A little desultory fighting
occurred, driving in the enemy’s advance parties on to their first position,
which we found at about 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> The guns and Infantry then came up
and cleared the position in about an hour. During the action we were
exposed to a good deal of shell fire, which fortunately did no harm, owing
to the ground being soft and the shells burying themselves before
bursting, if they burst at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>At 12 the advance was made on their second and main position,
about two miles off, and lying some five miles north-east of Brandfort.
The enemy offered little resistance, confining themselves chiefly to long-range
artillery fire. When the position was practically taken the Mounted
Infantry were sent away to the right flank to make a wide turning movement
with a view to cutting off the retreat of ‘Long Tom,’ who, however,
catching them on a wide open plain, forced them to dismount for the
attack. The dismounted men advanced some two miles in his direction,
but dusk setting in it became evident that it was impossible to reach that
position with daylight, and we were ordered to rejoin our horses and
return to camp. This we reached about 8 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, having been in the saddle
fifteen hours and covered quite forty miles. There had been no time
during the day to feed the horses, which consequently felt the work very
much. Our casualties were nil; but ten horses died from exhaustion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>To troopers in the ranks, however, it seemed a much more
serious affair, as well it might, for on them fell the burden of an
advance that tried their powers of endurance if it did not put a
very severe strain on their nerves. One of them, writing rather
for his own gratification than with the idea of helping to make
history, gives a graphic picture of the movement out of camp in
the darkest hour before dawn to join other troops, and then trot
on through the ‘pitch blackness’ over ground on which stones
seemed to have cropped up suddenly where no stones had been
before, so that horses stumbled at every stride. Then, as it grew
lighter, they saw that a whole army was with them, extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>along a front that stretched for miles. Lumsden’s Horse halted
under a hill near Ospruit, and British guns opened fire from its
crest. At this point the trooper’s hasty notes become ruggedly
picturesque as he describes the sequence of events:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The Boer artillery replied, and it became rather a hot corner. Shells
burst all round us and over our heads. We were retired and lay down.
Then moved to the right, gave over our horses to the even numbers, and
moved forward on foot, extending to some ten paces apart. So we
advanced, sometimes mounted, sometimes on foot—always extended.
Then lay down, then advanced again, and lay down—all in long parallel
lines, Lumsden’s Horse being on the extreme right, or nearly so. The
Infantry marched in beautifully regular and even straight lines, apparently
quite indifferent to the Boer guns that now opened on them and made
good shooting too. The shell fell all amongst those Infantry, but when
the dust cleared nobody seemed to be down, and the line went on unmoved.
Then some shells came in our direction, but either fell short or
whistled over our heads doing no harm; yet we were retired a bit.
Then a pom-pom of ours came into action and silenced the Boer guns.
This was all straight ahead. Meanwhile a gun opened across our front
at some Boers, whom we could see plainly retreating on the right. They
replied until the pom-poms behind us opened on them. Then they
bolted and were chased by some Mounted Infantry who came up on our
flank. Again we advanced on foot and got near the big kopje. Then
Colonel Lumsden rode up, called for the horses, and ordered us to advance
and join other corps of the 8th Mounted Infantry in a flank attack. Off
we went at a trot, and then, extending to intervals of ten paces, advanced
towards the kopje in front of us at a walk, but still mounted. Suddenly
there was a bang, and a few seconds later a shell burst dead on for our
centre, but some 200 yards short. After a brief pause a second shell
burst 100 yards nearer, and then another, the fragments of which
kicked up the dust all round us. This we discovered was what Cavalry
called ‘being out to draw fire.’ Still we advanced. Bang went the
gun again, and there was a cloud of dust followed by a tremendous
report not twenty yards from Clifford, Cayley, and me. Iron whizzed
over our heads, but nobody was hit. Our horses plunged and wheeled
round, and, seeing everyone was off, we did not stop either. Halted and
dismounted at a farmhouse lower down near a stream, where the company
assembled. Then handed over our horses, and, advancing again, with lots
of others on foot, trudged a weary two miles, when a Boer Maxim opened
on us; but though the bullets swept ground between the front line and
ourselves, they did no harm. When darkness began to fall the order
came for us to retire, and, our horses being brought up, we rode back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>over dykes and sluits and boggy places in the pitch black. Nobody
knew the way, but, seeing lights on our right, we made for them, and got
into camp about 7 o’clock. Not a bad day’s work, having started at
3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> with nothing whatever in the way of food to start on. Tied our
nags up. Everybody too tired to boil a kettle, or even light a fire. Ate
half a biscuit and some bully-beef and turned in. The left half-company
having come back to camp comparatively early, got into a hen-roost and
made great store of fowls, turkeys, and ducks. Heard that two foreign
officers had been taken—one German and one Russian—who said it was
useless going on, as the Boers would not stand and would not fight. So
ended the Battle of Brandfort.</p>

<p>BRINGING HALF RATIONS UP TO NORMAL<br /><span class='small'>(<em>From a sketch by J.S. Cowen</em>)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden takes up the narrative at this point in an
official report to the executive committee, and without attempting
to describe the general operations he gives a clear outline of
events in which his corps took a prominent part, leaving details
to be filled in by troopers according to their various views, and
they give some realistic sketches, not only of the actions but
also of the men under fire. In Colonel Lumsden’s epitome of a
day when the troops were supposed to rest and gain fresh vigour
for a forward movement, there is a meaning that could not have
been better expressed than it is in this short sentence:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th we halted, with no food for horses and only biscuit for the
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 5th, when the enemy were driven from a strong position on
the banks of Vet River, we had a long dragging day, most of the march
being done on foot to ease our tired horses, and with little hope of finding
any enemy in front of us, though away on our flank the artillery on both
sides were hotly engaged. At about 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we suddenly got the order to
change direction to the left and head for Vet railway station, which
the enemy held in force. We crossed the Vet river, where Boer commandos
had been making a stubborn stand, and soon found ourselves
among our Infantry. Shortly afterwards our guns opened fire and our
Infantry came into action, while the Mounted Infantry were sent round
by our right—northwards—to intercept, if possible, the retreating enemy.
It was a race for the same drift again among the Mounted Infantry, and
we got there first. Crossing the river, we were told to push forward
as fast as possible and seize a kopje two miles off which commanded a
somewhat deep valley on the left, up which the enemy were retiring.
As it was supposed to be a race between us and the enemy for the kopje,
we had not the time to make a thorough reconnaissance before approaching,
with the result that our scouts arrived at the kopje only some 600
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>to 700 yards before us, and the enemy had a charge at us at 800 yards.
We immediately opened out and took cover behind the bund of a tank
fifty yards in rear, and, dismounting, opened fire on the kopje and silenced
it. We were unable to stay there, as the enemy from the valley were
galloping up on our left under the cover of the kopje, so I gave the order
to my sixty men to mount and retire on our supports, who were now
coming up a quarter-mile in rear. We were only just in time, for, as we
were mounting, the Boer pom-pom treated us to a ‘belt’ the shells of
which came fair into the middle of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The supports now opened fire with two pom-poms and 200 men, and
the enemy retired, leaving us free to return to camp, which we reached at
7 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>—another long day of quite thirty miles. Our casualties were only
one scout killed when reconnoitring this kopje. This was Private
A.K. Meares, who was shot through the heart, and whom we buried the
following morning.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>One of the scouts who was with young Meares when they
reconnoitred the kopje describes that episode with convincing
directness, and incidentally records a very gallant action on the
part of Lieutenant Pugh, as if it were the most commonplace
occurrence. Following is his version of the affair given in
extracts from a private letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>By 2 in the afternoon we were fairly in touch with the enemy,
and an artillery duel commenced. After some time our fire grew too hot
for the Boers, and they retired with their guns. We had been sent
forward to try to turn the Boer flank, and our section, No. 4 B, was
ordered to seize a kopje which was supposed to be unoccupied. We, of
the advanced party, cantered up to within 250 yards of the enemy’s
sangar, and then they opened on us, but I must say they made very bad
shooting; we had got within 200 yards of them before turning to retire,
and yet only one man was hit. We were all in line, about twelve of us,
in skirmishing order, when the Boers opened fire, and when the order
to retire reached us we went back as fast as we could. Meares—the
man who was killed—and I were going in the same direction, and as his
horse was dead done, and had already fallen once during the day, I
reined up so as to get near him in case of need. I was just a little ahead
of him and kept glancing round to see how he was doing. In looking
after him I quite forgot my own horse, and then I don’t know what
happened. All I know is that half an hour afterwards I found myself
breathless, holding one of our officer’s stirrup-leathers and running for
dear life. My horse, it seems, got into a hole and came down an awful
crash on top of me. The others thought both the horse and I had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>shot. Almost immediately after this Meares went down, shot through
the heart from the back. Both our horses righted themselves, and
galloped back to the section. I lay stunned for half an hour, and then,
as I have told you, I staggered up to No. 2 section, who were covering
our retreat. I believe I was making straight for the Boer line of fire,
when one of our officers shouted out to me and gave me his stirrup-leather
to hold as I came up to him. I was so completely done after a short run
that he got off his horse and gave me a lift on it. Lieutenant Pugh
was the man. It was dark by this time, and as we had driven the
Boers off we retired to our camp. I picked up my section again, and
found my horse, who was badly cut about the head. My face was in a
lovely condition—one eye closed, and my cheek, forehead, and nose one
big bruise, and my head was splitting with pain. It was a providential
escape, and if I had not fallen I should surely have shared Meares’s fate.</p>

    <div>N.C.O.S AND TROOPERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In the simple phrases of another trooper who relates with
more fulness the circumstances in which Trooper A.K. Meares
met his death there are some pathetic touches:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We had several severe engagements, in one of which I am sorry to
say young Meares was shot dead while his company (B) were retiring
from a very large force of Boers with a few guns. It was altogether a
sad affair, as his brother Willie was riding next him. Being in extended
order, however, they were fifty yards or so apart, and Willie knew
nothing about his brother being hit till he got into camp and found
who was missing. It was then some men said they had seen him fall off
his nag, but could tell no more. Willie went with a party next morning
and found his brother dead. The bullet-wound was right over his heart.
He was buried there. What makes it all the more pathetic is that young
Meares was the only man hit that day, no one else getting a scratch.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Though the Boers made a brave show up to the last, disputing
every position a hold of which gave them any advantage, the
resistance offered by them to Lumsden’s Horse was only an expiring
effort. Their right flank had by that time been turned by
other corps of Mounted Infantry, among whom the Colonials vied
with each other for distinction, and at nightfall, when Australians
with a machine gun had come up to relieve Lumsden’s Horse,
the enemy retired, leaving a Maxim gun and twenty-six prisoners
in our hands. Again, however, they had carried off all their
heavy artillery and equipage, although General Ian Hamilton
had that afternoon got possession of Winburg and was threatening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>their rear. The events of following days are summarised briefly
by Colonel Lumsden in his official report:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, the 6th, saw us away at daybreak back for the
yesterday’s battlefield and towards the rising sun. We could see clearly
how clever had been the Boer plan of attack and how nearly they had
caught some of us. We followed up their tracks for many miles, halted
at noon for an hour, continued scouring the country—this time north—and
eventually headed west, arriving at dusk at our new camp near
Smaldeel, having advanced only three and a half miles after marching
thirty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away at dawn on the 7th, and, heading north, tramped many a mile
on foot, striking the railway between Vet and Winburg a few miles
from Vet, and continuing north some distance. We halted for two or
three hours, and then retraced our steps to a camp near the railway,
reaching it after dusk.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th our regiment did flank guard for the Infantry during a
march of twenty miles, saw innumerable buck, and commandeered twenty
remounts on payment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>With the incident thus delicately touched upon by Colonel
Lumsden an irresponsible trooper deals more at large in a way
that enables us to understand the troubles by which some commanding
officers were beset when their men, unlike Lumsden’s
Horse, did not think it necessary to go through the formality of
paying for what they took. Writing from Smaldeel, the trooper
says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday we went fairly straight, but about two or three miles too
far, and had to come back; but we caught a young Boer leaving his farm
with a rifle and ammunition, and we got another at the farm. The farm
was looted of all its live-stock. The Colonel stopped it when he came up,
but all the poultry was taken. Our men paid for everything. Kruger has
told all these people that their farms will be burned and all the women taken
prisoners. I think they were rather relieved when we left. One woman
said her husband had come back three weeks ago and died of wounds, and
they said the Free-Staters had lost terribly. They never hear officially,
as they keep the deaths dark, but almost every farm has lost at least one
man. In one we passed there were three widows. They are rather nice
people and can nearly all speak English, and are rather nice-looking.
We have fifty-one horses sick—about half with pink-eye and the other half
sore backs and lame—but we make it up by degrees. Yesterday we collected
eleven and the day before about the same, but in the night they got
away. We also brought along 200 sheep and some cows; the sheep we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>have given over to the brigade, except about twenty for our own use. We
carry with us to-morrow two days’ rations and four on the carts in case
the transport don’t come up. McMinn and Francis, of my section, got lost
leading sick horses. McMinn has attached himself to another brigade,
but nothing has been heard of Francis.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The self-restraint exercised by soldiers who left untouched
the stores and paid for all the live-stock they took at every farm
where women and children had been left by the retreating Boers
will be appreciated by all who know what it is to march and fight
day after day on short rations. Though Lumsden’s Horse laid
in that store of supplies, it did not last them many days, as we
gather from a continuation of the Colonel’s diary:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th the usual daybreak start, our men with two days’ biscuits
and one day’s feed for horses, but the officers with only some chocolate,
as we relied on our mess cart being up. We were with the main body
this day, till we neared the crossing of the Zand River at the Virginia
Siding railway bridge, which had been blown up the day before, and at
this point our companies were detached on each side of the drift to
prevent a surprise. We heard General Hamilton having an artillery duel
with the foe some miles off on our right, while on the left we saw the
Mounted Infantry dislodging the enemy’s advance parties, the war
balloon with Lord Roberts and Staff being near the drift itself. We
received orders to concentrate and move away to the left, and on the
far side of the river to join our corps—the 8th Mounted Infantry—on
doing which we were immediately sent into action dismounted, firing at
1,500 yards, while the enemy’s pom-pom shells flew whistling over our
heads as they aimed at our guns behind us. Our corps here got its first
definite order, and that was, ‘Keep touch with the enemy at any cost.’
As this came from Lord Roberts direct, we proceeded to obey it to the
letter, with the result that we were under shell and rifle fire for the remainder
of the day. Having got well ahead of the rest of our brigade,
in following up ‘Long Tom,’ which halted and fired on us at intervals,
we kept running into the enemy’s supporting Infantry, whom we only
managed to discomfit thoroughly when we got at them with our Maxim
on the open hillside. Our losses were only two horses wounded. We
were severely shelled several times, but we escaped casualties through
being widely extended and also through the faulty bursting of the
enemy’s shells. On one occasion ten shells burst among us within five
minutes. About 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, in company with Colonel Ross, I went to endeavour
to get some support, and brought up one company of Loch’s
Horse, one company Tasmanians, and one company South Australian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Rifles, afterwards meeting General Hutton with a battery Field Artillery,
which promptly went into action on our left flank and shelled the Boers,
who were then retiring. Unfortunately, our force was much too weak
to attempt to follow them in the open. Had it not been so it was the
opinion of General Hutton and Colonel Ross that we might have captured
the whole of them—some 1,500, with a couple of guns. Dusk
had then drawn on, and, having lost touch with our brigade, we
marched under General Hutton’s orders to a camping ground seven miles
off in the direction of Kroonstad, arriving about 9 P.M., without food
for men or horses, and there was no firewood within miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The troopers had each little else but dry biscuit, the officers faring
hardly any better.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another correspondent writes of this affair:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We had a very pretty fight at the Zand River, and were within an
ace of taking two of the enemy’s big guns. To begin at the beginning.
We had marched the previous day from our camp near Smaldeel to
within about five miles of the Zand River. On our arrival there we
heard that the Australians and Oxfords had been having a skirmish with
some Boers at the bridge, and had seized a train of stores, but were
forced to retire. Starting at daybreak in the second line of Mounted
Infantry, we got across the drift all right, and drove the Boer outposts
back. We sat on the further side of the river for about an hour, watching
them bring up two big guns on to a kopje about three miles off, and
wondering when we should be shelled. Presently we were ordered off on
a flank movement, and after trotting some miles came in touch with
the enemy. We dismounted, and moved up a valley with good cover,
the pom-poms following. They drove back the Boer riflemen and
presently silenced a gun, which had been amusing itself by shelling our
led horses, but luckily without effect. We mounted again and started for
a two-mile gallop to get up with their gun, but it had disappeared.
Making a flank movement round the shoulder of the position they had
occupied, and pushing on some distance, we found them again, or rather
they found us first. Their gun got our range beautifully, but every
shell seemed to fall and burst between the horses. Of course we were
widely extended. Retiring, we dismounted and then advanced on foot,
but their rifle fire and shell fire was too hot; so again we tried to out-flank
their position. A Company and half of B Company advanced,
and we climbed a small kopje with a deserted Kaffir kraal on top;
Loch’s Horse, some of the Australians, and the West Riding Mounted
Infantry went round and took up a position further along the ridge.
We sat there for nearly two hours under a terrific shell fire, till it
dawned on us to move below the brow. For the first half-hour they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>landed shell after shell (40-pounders) right into the middle of us;
luckily, very few burst properly. If they had fired shrapnel, which
bursts in the air, or lyddite, we should all have been blown off the
top. They then let our horses have a few shots, and killed two and
wounded three. In the meantime urgent messages were being sent
for our artillery, or at least the pom-poms that generally come with us,
but unfortunately they could get nothing but a walk out of their horses,
and the Boers quietly trekked away. We ought to have had them with
the greatest of ease, as we were well round them on two sides and a
brigade was moving somewhere on the third. If the Artillery had got up
in time we could easily have moved round the fourth side. We tried to
keep in touch with the Boers when they retired, but it soon got dark and
we had to stop.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>No stirring episodes or dramatic incidents marked the army’s
farther advance towards a stronghold which the Free State
Boers had declared that they would defend to the last. Colonel
Lumsden deals with this part of the operations briefly in the
following notes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Dawn on the 10th saw us in the saddle again on the move for
Kroonstad. The leading sections were constantly in touch with the
enemy, and sometimes under heavy shell fire, from which Corporal
Kirwan received a scalp wound not very serious. After a long and
weary march we halted at nightfall near a farm, where we were lucky
enough to get some Indian corn for the horses and a few sheep for
the men.</p>

<p class='c000'>We made an early start on the 11th for the expected big fight at
Kroonstad, it having been reported on the previous evening that the
enemy were strongly posted five miles on our side of the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>We advanced for ten miles with the utmost military precaution, only to
find that the enemy had vacated the position, leaving Kroonstad undefended.
Lord Roberts marched in at 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, followed by the Guards and
the rest of the Infantry, the mounted troops flanking both sides of the
town. We occupied heights on the left, and halted there for the night,
changing ground next morning to our present camping ground, a mile
distant, where, with the rest of the army, we are waiting for supplies for
horses and men, before a forward movement towards Pretoria can be
made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The halt has been a welcome one, as our horses are fairly done, and I
doubt if I could mount 150 men to-morrow, and a few more weeks’ work
like that of the last would reduce the numbers to 100. We are leaving a
dozen horses to-day as unfit to march, and shot six yesterday. Cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>horses wander about all over the veldt and lie dead in the river or any
other quiet place, and fatigue parties are ceaselessly at work burying the
bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>You can form no idea of the condition of our horses, and, but for the
fact that we have been able to commandeer and get remounts <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span>,
we should have half our corps dismounted. We have lost quite seventy-five
horses already. I have stated officially that we require immediately
seventy-five remounts more, and these we expect to get this afternoon.
Mrs. Barrow’s ‘Molly Riley’ looks like a bathing-machine horse, and I
fear is on her last march.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men are all very well and in good spirits, are most efficient cooks,
and if allowed would rank high as looters; but orders against this are very
strict, and our men pay liberally for anything in the shape of foodstuffs
wherever procurable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The office department has been rather upset by the loss of Sergeant
Fraser, of the Bank of Bengal, who was Paymaster and Secretary, but I
have replaced him by Graves, of the same bank, who is working up arrears
as quickly as possible. He is a very willing and intelligent young fellow,
and will soon have things straight again when he gets a few days’ halt,
but it is impossible to do much on the line of march.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The troops were not all so punctilious as Lumsden’s Horse
in the matter of prompt payment for things commandeered, and
a good story was told of one brigade at Kroonstad, whose commander,
in despair of being able to check irregularities, issued
an order that loot was ‘not to be carried openly on the saddle.’
Our soldiers, however, had not then been reduced by hardships
and scant fare to the necessity of providing for themselves at all
costs. Some pitiful cases of unauthorised commandeering were
reported in connection with later operations, when columns
moving rapidly through several districts had to draw supplies
from Boer farms and give receipts for them in lieu of cash payments.
Detached parties driven to straits for want of food did
not hesitate to adopt the means they had seen employed by
responsible officers, but took care to leave no trace by which they
could be identified. An officer who had to investigate these
cases told me of one receipt given to a Boer widow. It ran
thus: ‘Being without rations and hungry, we have taken all
this poor woman had of live-stock and food. She asks for a
receipt. I give it. God help her!—<span class='sc'>Ally Sloper</span>.’ To the credit
of British military administration, it must be said that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>document, though irregular, was accepted as genuine, and duly
honoured by payment in full.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse had their share of the privations that made
commandeering a necessity, and even looting pardonable; and it
is not to be wondered at if some among them regarded campaigning
in anything but the roseate light that imagination had
shed upon it before they left India. Yet, even at this time, their
conduct in circumstances that tried the character of men individually
and collectively won approval from such a soldier as
Colonel Ward, C.B. (now Sir Edward Ward, K.C.B., Permanent
Under-Secretary of State for War). Singling them out on the
line of march, he asked what regiment they were, and seemed
astonished to learn that they were Volunteers. In a letter to
the Editor he says: ‘I was much struck with Lumsden’s Horse.
They were very keen and excellent soldiers.’ After an exceptionally
hard day one of them wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We were in the saddle at 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and did not bivouac till 8 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and
were under shell fire the greater portion of the day. We had two men
and several horses wounded; and two or three horses killed. It seemed
to me that our task always was to find where the enemy’s guns were
posted, as we invariably drew their fire on us. It was a fearfully long
day, and after fighting for ten hours we had to march for five, and when
we bivouacked we had nothing but a few dry biscuits and a little jam
to eat, but we were making coffee till midnight. We were up again
at 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and did an easy march to Kroonstad, where we commandeered
two fowls, and, having been served out with fresh mutton, we did ourselves
very well indeed. Some potatoes had been left in the farmhouse
garden, and these fried in dripping made a feast for epicures. Next
day we marched again, and, after skirmishing about the hills above
Kroonstad, camped outside the town. It had been evacuated by Boer
commandos the day before, and surrendered without a shot being fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Roberts received quite an ovation as he marched in, but we
only heard the cheers, as our corps was not in the town, but above it.
We have now marched right across the Orange State from Bethulie to
Kroonstad, and are wondering how much farther we shall go. There are all
sorts of rumours about camp—some say Lumsden’s Horse are to garrison
Kroonstad, others that we go on east to Harrismith, and others, again,
that we accompany Lord Roberts to Pretoria. There have been days
when but two men were left in the lines; all the rest have been on
fatigue or duty of some sort. Our horses, it is true, have been overworked
and underfed, but you will be able to form some idea of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>effects of ‘pink-eye’ and other African diseases when I tell you that of
the thirty men in our section alone who were well mounted when we
started from India there are about five of us riding our own horses now,
all the others have remounts; and our section is not the worst in this
respect. My horse is doing me splendidly; except for a sore back for a
few days, he has never been sick or sorry.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have learnt to cook now, and can serve up chops, steaks, stews, and
curries as well as any cook—when we can get the meat. We have been
lucky lately in bivouacking near farmhouses, as we can commandeer
chickens and sheep, paying for them when we are caught! We have, for
the last few days, been getting to our camps after sundown, and by the
time the fires are lighted and the meat ready to cook it is quite 9 o’clock.
It takes an hour or so to cook, and the eating lasts longer, as the meat
stands a deal of masticating. We seldom get to bed before 12, and are
always ready by 5 o’clock, so you can imagine how invigorating the
climate of this place is. It is bitterly cold at night and hot in the day,
yet very few of our men are down with fever. It is a fine climate, but a
fearful country. For miles and miles you see nothing but immense, undulating,
treeless, waterless tracts of poor pasture-land. Here and there you
find small ponds of dirty water, but whether it is rain-water dammed up
or whether these are springs I have not yet been able to ascertain. The
farmers here make their living by breeding cattle, and not by cultivation
at all. We have marched from one end of the Orange State to the other,
and I don’t suppose all the cultivation I have seen would cover ten acres.
A year of drought or disease, I should think, would tell very heavily on
farmers here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Queen’s Town is the only town in Africa that I can really say I have
seen; we either camped outside the other towns or merely passed
through without having time to see them. We rode through Bloemfontein,
and from what I could see of it it seems to be a large town built
on the slopes of two or three converging hills, and fairly dirty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the towns we have passed consisted of half-a-dozen zinc
houses, two at least of which are bound to be churches; of the remaining
four, one will be a store and the rest dwelling-houses. But each dwelling-house
is a township in itself. Even the ‘mild Hindu’ marvels at the
number of people who live in one house, no matter how small it may be.
There was a farmhouse near our camp at Bloemfontein, where we used to
go sometimes to get a cup of coffee. This house had two rooms, each
one about twenty-five feet square. It contained the following permanent
residents—they said, they had visitors sometimes too—one old woman and
three young ones and three young men and six children of sorts and sizes.
One of the rooms was used as a kitchen and larder, so there was only one
for general use. Needless to say, these people were Boers!</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>One trooper of A Company, writing to friends in Calcutta,
has nothing but expressions of admiration for the behaviour of
British Bluejackets, to whom he pays appreciative tribute in the
following extract:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At Zand River, on the 10th, I was with the naval guns in action.
It was simply grand to see the sailors work them. They were drawn
up a drift in the Zand River by teams of thirty bullocks per gun, and
opened fire from the top of the left bank on the enemy’s position at
7,200 yards range, and in five shots had blown up one Boer gun and
knocked the whole shoot down about their ears. When the first gun was
fired I happened to be quite near, although at one side of it, and the
force of the explosion made me stagger as if a man were in a strong
north-wester trying to make headway.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Even the novelty of such things, however, soon began to
wear off, and under the depressing influences of life in a rest
camp outside Kroonstad the trooper took a more gloomy view
of things military, writing:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>This place is like most of the so-called towns in South Africa, a
mere cluster of tin huts with hardly a stone building in the lot. We,
as usual, are not within a mile and a half of the town, and only one
man per section of twenty-eight is allowed into it at a time. When
you do get there, there is nothing much to buy or see, and prices are
extremely high. Thank goodness, the climate at this time of year is
just grand; at night it is very cold, and in the day warm, but never too
warm unless one happens to be very hard at work. We seldom have any
time to ourselves; even now, though I am writing letters, I am on duty
with forty other men grazing the horses, about a couple of miles from
camp. We are in a bad way for nags now, and very few of the Calcutta
horses are left. It’s fun going out to commandeer things from the Boer
farms, and it would make a person roar to see the different things different
people choose to take. We are generally in a bad way for firewood, as this
is practically a treeless country; so we break up chairs, beds, floors, doors,
posts, rafters, and every blessed piece of wood to be got. Here as I sit on
the side of a kopje I have a loaded rifle and cartridge bandolier on, and we
are warned to stand to arms at any moment, as there are some wandering
Boers about on the war-path who have cut the wires and played Old
Nick with the railway and Bridges. It’s wonderful what good health men
keep, considering the hardships they go through; we have not got a tent
among the lot of us, barring those small servants’ tents used by the officers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Many among us have not even a change of clothes, on account of a <em>golmal</em><a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
made in regard to our kit bags, which got left behind at a camp near
Bloemfontein. Goodness knows if we shall ever see those bags again. At
present I have only the clothes on my back and one extra pair of socks to
my name. Many of us have started growing long beards, and I have a
beauty, but it wants a little trimming. I had a bath about four days ago,
the first for weeks, and please goodness I will have a swim before leaving
this place, as there is a river here which, though rather full of dead
mules and horses, is better than nothing at all. Yesterday three horses
got stuck in the river and were drowned, and this morning when watering
horses I saw three mules and another nag which belonged to our Maxim
gun team <em>panklagged</em>, and I fear that they also have been lost. There
is most awful ‘pank’ in some of the rivers and ponds, and on more than
one occasion we have all but lost men when crossing or watering. I have
had about enough of it, and so has everyone else. It does make a man
feel creepy when he has shells bursting about all round, and Boer shells do
burst, for all that is said otherwise. They make a noise in the air like a
huge flock of ducks when they take a dive downwards in their flight; and
the rifle bullets going past sound like a breeze playing in the branches of
a tree. I have now been in three engagements, and I’m perfectly satisfied!
I don’t mind it where there is some cover, and you can see your enemy;
but when the bullets come from Lord knows where, it’s real tough bread
and butter to chew. The day we lost so heavily the Boers were rifle
firing at over 2,000 yards, and as they use smokeless powder it was
impossible to see them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In those closing sentences there is a realistic touch that tells
of the weariness and heart-sickness from which soldiers invariably
suffer in days of rest following a succession of hard
marches and heavy fighting. When there is stern work to be
done, or a foe to be faced, these men may succumb to sheer
exhaustion without a word of complaint. It is only after a day
or two of comparative inaction, when supposed, by a pleasant
fiction, to be resting in camp, that they will confess to being
tired of the whole thing, or, as Tommy expresses it, ‘fair fed up.’
A total change comes with the order for a fresh advance, and
everybody welcomes it except, perhaps, the regimental commanding
officer, who knows that his horses would be all the
better if given more time to regain condition, and his men more
happy if there were a chance of re-clothing them. But what do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>rags and tatters matter when days have to be spent in marching
through clouds of red dust and night blots out all distinction
between weather-stained khaki and the soil on which it is laid?
Colonel Lumsden must have felt the care for such things heavy
on him, but he gave no sign of it in the notes by which he
summarised the renewal of operations and of hard work that
was in inverse ratio to the number of words employed in
describing it:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We halted at Kroonstad till the 22nd, and then moved out some
four and a half miles to a fresh camp clear of the town ready to join
Colonel Henry’s brigade, and to start marching early next morning.
Nothing of interest occurred at Kroonstad, except that we were able
to leave behind a number of worn-out horses. These were replaced by
fifty-six Argentines, which arrived the day before we left in a sorry condition,
suffering from the effects of forced marches made without food,
except what they could pick up on the veldt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next three days were spent in long weary marches, reconnoitring
the country in front of the main advance, for we had been transferred at
Kroonstad from General Hamilton’s column to the troops selected to
march with Lord Roberts. Just after the men had settled down in
camp at sunset on the 24th, bugles sounded a single G, and, on hearing
this signal, all troops joined in singing ‘God Save the Queen.’</p>

<p class='c000'>We were expecting to be in action every day, but nothing was seen of
the enemy till the 26th, when we came upon him at about 9 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> in the
railway station near Viljoen’s Drift, half a mile from the Vaal River.
There some time was spent in reconnoitring to find out the enemy’s
strength, and when a few shells had been put into the station, turning
out only a hundred Boers, we were too late to stop the train which had
apparently been loading up there. It steamed unhurt over the Vaal
bridge, which was immediately blown up.</p>

<p class='c000'>A general advance of the 8th Corps was made dismounted, and the
enemy driven back, so that at noon the whole brigade was over the Vaal,
much to the delight of the manager of the mines, who had been in a state
of great anxiety. He treated all officers to breakfast, and told us that the
Boers had not expected our force for two days, and that the party just
ejected by us had arrived that very morning with the intention of blowing
up his mines. He estimated that one million sterling had been saved by
our unexpected arrival.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our only casualty during the day was Sergeant H.A. Campbell,
slightly wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>At 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we moved off to our new camp, guarding the Vaal bridge,
with the promise of a sorely-needed halt next day.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>From this brief chronicle nobody would suppose that the
honour of reconnoitring and drawing Boers out from their hiding-places
among the sheds and shanties of corrugated iron at
Viljoen’s Drift Station had fallen to Lumsden’s Horse. Lieutenant
Pugh, however, supplies the missing links in a private
letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div id='i228'  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i_b_228.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Bassano</em></span><br />SERGEANT PERCY JONES, D.C.M.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c000'>It was my section’s turn to do the scouting, and they did very well,
getting information that there was a train and fifty men in the station
this side of the Vaal. Two other regiments of Mounted Infantry each
sent out an officer’s patrol of about fifty men, and each came back full
split. One of their officers told my
scouts that if they did not wish to
be shot they had better clear,
but Peddie thought this was not
business; he, being in charge of
the advanced scouts, went on till
they were fired on and then halted.
We had to wait for orders to
advance for about half an hour,
and saw the train steam out of
the station and over the bridge
and presently blow up one span.
With a dash we could have caught
the men and train, and probably
saved the bridge, as we had two
Maxims, and we could easily have
driven the Boers off. We then
crossed the river and drove their
rearguard out of Vereeniging.
They took the opportunity of
burning a large store of mealies at
the station. Our guns got into
them well as they bolted across the plain. We had a very nice fight, and
everyone is much pleased, even the Chief of the Staff.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Through all this advance, in which Lumsden’s Horse, with
other corps of the 8th Mounted Infantry, reconnoitred ahead of
the army, troopers who had been trained to field sports proved
invaluable, and sometimes at least a match for the wily Boer.
Nobody distinguished himself more by skill at this work than
Corporal Percy Jones, whom Colonel Lumsden regarded as one
of his best scouts, a man of great self-reliance, unfailing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>resources, and with a very keen eye for a country, so that he
never allowed the section of which he was leader to be entrapped
or surprised. For repeated acts of daring enterprise he was promoted
to the rank of sergeant and given the ‘Distinguished
Conduct’ Medal. Others who, being selected for some specially
difficult or dangerous duty, had on occasion distinguished themselves
as scouts, or who, by actions of individual gallantry, won
mention in despatches, with subsequent honours, were Trooper
Preston (D.C.M.), Trooper H.N. Betts (D.C.M.), Trooper W.B.
Dexter (D.C.M.), and Corporal G. Peddie. Trooper H.R. Parks,
Sergeant Dale, Sergeant Llewhellin, and Corporal C.E. Turner
also performed meritorious actions, for which they were mentioned
in despatches.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though little has been said of the privations endured by our
soldiers during their forced marches from Kroonstad to reach the
Vaal River before its steep sandy banks could be made formidable
by entrenchments, as the Modder was, some troops suffered
severely from want of sufficient food, and nearly all were on
short rations. It is certain, however, that not many could have
been so near the ravenous stage of starvation as a private in one
colonial corps, of whose act a trooper of Lumsden’s Horse writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The day we crossed the Vaal River a very interesting thing happened;
we were very hungry, and when we got to Vereeniging a dog was seen
running away with half a loaf of bread in his mouth. Immediately a
private darted out of the ranks and rode the dog down, took the bread out
of his mouth, and ate it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>At last Lumsden’s Horse were on Transvaal territory.
Another vaunted stronghold, which the Boers had declared they
would defend to the last extremity, was in our hands, without
even the semblance of a struggle for it. Generals French and
Hutton had crossed the Vaal at important strategic points west
of Vereeniging. All the most important drifts were thus held by
us, and the ways open for British columns to enter the Transvaal
without opposition. On the following day Lord Roberts,
with his headquarters, moved across Viljoen’s Drift and issued
a proclamation declaring that the Orange Free State had ceased
to exist, and had become from that moment an integral part of the
British Empire, to be known henceforth as Orange River Colony.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In all operations up to this point Lumsden’s Horse, with Loch’s
Horse and companies of the West Riding and Oxfordshire Light
Infantry, forming the 8th Mounted Infantry Regiment, under
Colonel Ross, had, with other corps of Colonel Henry’s brigade,
been so actively engaged scouting ahead of the main column
with which Lord Roberts moved, that they had neither time nor
opportunity to know what was being done by other divisions of
the army. It is necessary, therefore, to explain briefly here the
general dispositions for an advance on Pretoria at the moment
when Lord Roberts crossed Vaal River into Transvaal territory.
Since they marched out of Kroonstad the troops, whose advance
was most direct—following the line of railway with slight
divergences—had covered just a hundred miles in four days.
Mounted troops, being employed to reconnoitre on each flank
and keep up communications along their front, almost doubled
that distance. In face of such a rapid advance the Boer commandos
which had dispersed after their evacuation of Kroonstad
found a difficulty in concentrating for the defence of any strategic
points. They were evidently puzzled by the sudden mobility of
British forces, and, what with Methuen marching for the west,
French’s Cavalry making a dash for the drifts at Parys and
Reitzburg, as if Potchefstroom were their objective, the main
column pushing along beside the railway for Viljoen’s Drift, and
Ian Hamilton marching as if for Engelbrecht’s Drift on the
Heilbron-Heidelberg road, the Boer commandants could not
agree as to which point would most likely be threatened first or
at which they might make a stand with the greatest chance of
success. Hasty preparations were made by them with a view to
checking General Ian Hamilton, whom they credited with a design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>on Heidelberg and the Eastern railways. Possibly that,
combined with a great movement in force upon the junctions
outside Johannesburg, might have been the shortest way to end
the war, because, as we know now, the Boer Generals attached
very little importance to the defence of their big towns, while
they realised fully all the strategical advantages of free communication
between Pretoria and the eastern districts; and President
Kruger especially was anxious to keep open a line by which
prominent members of his Administration might be able to get
away with a sufficient store of bullion for private and political
uses at the last moment. The defenders of Engelbrecht’s Drift,
however, waited in vain watching the trap they had laid for
General Ian Hamilton. His line of march had been suddenly
changed by orders from Lord Roberts, and, instead of crossing
the Vaal where he was expected, east of Vereeniging, he had
made a rapid march westward to strike the river between General
French’s Cavalry and the main body, leaving our right flank to
be guarded by General Gordon with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade.
With regard to all this and the ceremony at Viljoen’s Drift,
when Lord Roberts proclaimed the annexation of Orange Free
State to the British Crown, Lumsden’s Horse knew nothing at
the time. Content with their own share of the good work that
had been accomplished, they were consoling themselves by the
prospect of at least one day’s well-earned rest for men and horses.
But that good fortune was not to be theirs after all. Colonel
Lumsden, continuing his official record, explains how these
pleasant hopes were dashed:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The 27th dawned, the horses were turned out to graze, leave was given
for men to go into town, and general cleaning up began, when suddenly
at 10.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we had an order to move at once to help the 3rd Cavalry
Brigade under General Gordon, who was reported to be in a tight corner
to the north-east. Horses were caught, saddles put on, and we were
away by 11, with no rations for man or horse. The rest of the brigade
joined in four miles further on. All proceeded with every precaution
through a difficult bit of trappy country, arriving about 4.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> at the
drift where General Gordon was supposed to be stuck up. There no
signs of him could be seen, so we made tracks back to a point four
miles north of Vereeniging, where we were to have joined our column,
when it camped there that night. We struggled on until, our horses
giving out, the whole brigade bivouacked at 8 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, having put behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>us some seven miles of our return journey, and having done quite twenty-five
miles. Lieutenant Neville, with a guide, was sent in to headquarters
for instructions, and returned at 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> with the order that our brigade
was to come on at once and resume its position in front of the headquarters,
leading the army. By 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we were away again in the
bitter frosty cold, leading our starved horses, the sun rising as we waded
a nasty drift over the Klip. We reached our place in the advance guard
at 7, in the nick of time, just as all had begun to move off, and were at
once pushed on three miles at a trot ahead of everything, fighting being
expected at the notorious Klip River position. No Boers, however, were
seen. The country was ablaze with the burning veldt, which the Boers
had set fire to systematically as they went, and the Klip River was gained
without a shot. There were sounds
of heavy fighting, however, in the
hills on our left, where French
and Hamilton were forcing back
the enemy on Johannesburg.</p>

<p>LIEUTENANT G.A. NEVILLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With an editorial desire to
link the separate operations
into one chain, I may here
describe from personal experience
what happened away on
that left flank where French
and Hamilton were hotly engaged
with the outposts of a
Boer force, whose object in
holding the high kopjes between
Gatsrand and Klipriviersberg
was obviously to
force upon us a wider flanking
movement, by which the
western columns would be further separated from the main body
and thus unable to co-operate with it effectively. It is improbable
that Louis Botha had any hope of being able to defeat the British
forces in detail by delivering a counter-stroke on each column in
turn. It is far more likely that his idea even at that period was
to lengthen out the British line of communications as far as
possible, thus weakening it by attenuation and making it more
vulnerable to attacks by small raiding parties. Co-operating with
him was Christian De Wet, to whom such a plan would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>been sure to commend itself as offering a chance for numbers
of Free-Staters to slip through the girdle that was gradually
closing about them, re-cross the Vaal, and harass their enemies
on ground where local knowledge would give them every advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this supposition the resistance offered to General French
some twenty-five miles north-west of Vereeniging had peculiar
interest for me, because I watched the operations there with
some foreknowledge of the probable Boer tactics gained in a
curious way. Four days earlier I had breakfasted at a farm
next to Christian De Wet’s, not far from Rodewal station. The
farmer invited myself and a companion into his house, above
which a white flag was flying, and when told that this was our
Queen’s birthday he produced a bottle of whisky with which to
drink to Her Majesty’s health, which we did readily enough,
although he declined to join us. There was no unfriendliness
or want of hospitality in that, and, indeed, we should have mistrusted
the man if he had put on a pretence of loyalty because
he had been induced to hoist the white flag as an emblem of
neutrality. There were no troops at that moment nearer than
Lumsden’s Horse, who could be seen on the sky-line about four
miles westward, moving towards Vredefort Road Station.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that direction presently came a young Boer well
mounted but unarmed. His wary movements at first seemed to
indicate that he had no desire to be seen by our troops, but our
host explained that the road took many turns and twists which
might puzzle a stranger. The horseman was evidently not well
pleased to find Englishmen at the farm, but this we, being somewhat
vain, attributed to jealousy, seeing that the youth and our
host’s comely daughter were exchanging glances in which there
might have been a world of other meaning, though we suspected
it not. We knew instinctively that they were not quite
strangers, but there were no signs of friendly recognition in our
presence. After a brief conversation, carried on between the
young man and the farmer aside, though neither of us could
have understood the taal they talked, our host came forward
and explained that his neighbour was simply riding from one
farm to another, where the family had all surrendered and
obtained their permits to live in peace. There was nothing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>be done then except shake hands and part, but the next day my
Basuto servant, who, having lived in Johannesburg, had a wholesome
dread of Boer sjamboks, gave me a full interpretation of
what he had overheard the young man say in that neighbourly
talk with our burgher friend. The burden of it was that this
guileless youth, Ferreira by name, had been sent by Christian De
Wet to let everybody know why the Free State commandos
were retiring with Botha’s Transvaalers instead of defending
their own homesteads. It was only to lure the English on to
destruction, and Christian De Wet promised that he would slip
back again in a day or two to Rodewal and play Old Harry with
the invaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to the time of joining General French’s force in the
afternoon of May 28 I had regarded this as a vain boast. A
closer study of Boer tactics, however, was enough to show what
they were playing for, and I watched with some apprehension
our Cavalry moving westward in vain attempts to outflank the
mobile Boers, who were galloping from kopje to kopje on one
side of a vast dam fringed by treacherous mires which French’s
squadrons could not cross. Ian Hamilton meanwhile conformed
to this movement without getting touch of the enemy or drawing
near to their stronghold, which was obviously on the frowning
crest of Klipriviersberg (shortened by the Boers colloquially to
Riviersberg).</p>

<p class='c000'>Being alone, and far from my supplies, I slept supperless
that night in a deserted Boer store, for the sake of such
shelter as a wall and roof might give from a keen icy wind
that swept in gusts through the broken windows. I had neither
overcoat nor blanket, and saw nothing to lie on but a filthy floor
or the bare laths of a rickety iron bedstead. I chose the latter.
Having been in the saddle from 5 in the morning until 10 at
night, with the exception of necessary halts for my horse to
graze, I was soon oblivious to the discomfort of that rude couch,
and, for all I knew, my pillow might have been softest down
instead of hard saddle-flaps. But long before daybreak the
cravings of a hunger that had only been tantalised by coffee and
biscuit twenty-four hours earlier awoke me to a consciousness
that my limbs were aching with cold and sore from the chafing
of those sharp-edged laths. Striking a light, I looked at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>little thermometer attached to my wallet, and found that it
registered ten degrees of frost. More sleep was not to be
thought of, so I groped through the darkness to a stall only
less draughty than the store I had slept in, found my horse
shivering there, rubbed him down with a wisp of straw, by way
of restoring his circulation and my own, and waited for the
dawn. Then I found my way across vleis and spruits to where
General Ian Hamilton’s force was moving off through dense mists
from Cyferfontein to attack the Boer position on Riviersberg.
When the rising sun dispelled those mists the Gordons and City
Imperial Volunteers were spread out in thin lines stretching
fan-like across a segment of the veldt, and so they went on hour
after hour without finding any sign of Boers. The pangs of
hunger being all-potent, I rode off in search of a farm, hoping
also to come across another British column within a few miles.
After an hour or more I was gladdened by the sight of Haartebeestefontein
Farm standing in the midst of green mealie-patches
and belted about by eucalyptus trees—the very picture
of peace. At that moment four Boers drove out from the farm-yard
in a well-horsed Cape cart, but made no sign at sight of me
except by driving the faster. They needn’t have been in such a
hurry to get away from an unarmed and famished Englishman,
who had not one comrade within miles. But luckily they didn’t
know.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though French’s Cavalry had been at the farm a day before
me and ransacked the Veldt-Cornet’s deserted house, in search of
any documents that might have been left there, ducks were
swimming in a pond close by and fowls cackling about the sheds
from which some Kaffirs presently appeared. To my request, for
bread or eggs or milk they had but one answer, ‘Ikona.’ The
sight of a loaded revolver might have produced some effect, but,
having none, I dismounted and made a systematic search. If food
in any shape was there it must have been very cleverly hidden.
Finding not so much as a bundle of oat-hay for my horse to
nibble at, I rode on across ridge and hollow another five miles or
so, and then came upon a little dorp or hamlet, from which all
the inhabitants except a Dutch schoolmaster and his wife had
disappeared. They declared that not a scrap of food had been
left behind. But the good vrau gave me a cup of excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>coffee, and with thanks for the best of hospitality, which gives all
it can, I jogged along another league or two, following the straight
road towards Johannesburg and expecting every minute to fall in
with the rearguard of a column going that way. All the while
I had not seen a single soldier or the trace of an iron-shod
hoof that was not at least a day old. The unmistakable marks
of ‘ammunition’ boots were not there, and neither horse nor
man had left footprints on tracks where the morning’s thaw had
softened them. At last from a rugged ridge I saw smoke curling
up from houses among the trees that marked the course of a river
some two miles ahead. Not caring much by that time whether
Britons or Boers might be in those houses, I rode straight for the
nearest of them, which turned out to be a farm in the barn of
which I saw much forage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently none of our mounted troops had been there, but it
was too late to think of turning back. That, in all probability,
would have brought a Mauser bullet whistling about my ears.
‘Bluff’ was the only game to play in such circumstances, so I
called to a Kaffir servant, told him to fetch forage for my horse,
and then swaggered towards the house as if I had been a Staff officer
with a whole regiment at my back. On the stoep a bearded Boer
met me. He had been lying prone on ground where rhenoster
bushes grew. Their burrs were still sticking to his serge jacket,
the left elbow of which was stained by the red earth on which it
had rested, and his right thumb was black with a coating of
burnt melinite. I saw it all as he raised one hand in a sort of
half-military salute, and extended the other to welcome me, and
in that moment I knew he had just come down from Riviersberg
heights for lunch in the intervals of fighting. So, still playing
an assumed part, I asked what weapons he had, and he brought
me a well-worn Martini-Henry; but that was not what I wanted.
After some show of misunderstanding the Boer brought his wife,
who talked English fluently enough, and when I had explained to
her the awful consequences of concealing arms or ammunition
from a British officer, holding plenary powers of punishment, there
was no necessity for saying any more. Without even waiting
for my words to be interpreted, her husband went out and came
back with a Mauser rifle, the fouling of which was still moist
round its breech-chamber, and a bandolier half full of cartridges.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>These I took charge of, not knowing what I should do with them if
a Boer commando happened to come that way. As to British
troops—well, at any rate, I had no hesitation in assuring the
Boer that his household would be safe from them. I did not think
it necessary to add that none would be likely to come anywhere
near him. In return for my leniency (save the mark!) he
suggested something that had been in my mind all the while,
and thereupon his good wife brought a deliciously white loaf and
milk that was fragrant in its freshness. She was sorry that they
‘had nothing better to offer.’ Nothing better! Heavens,
how sweet it tasted! Yet I was restrained from eating or drinking
much by the thought that any show of my famished state
would give me away. It was difficult to parry all questions concerning
the number of troops I had with me, so I said that my
men must have found a lot of arms to collect or they would have
been there sooner. Upon that the Boer volunteered information
as to the number of rifles which could possibly be in farms or
cottages round about. All this information I noted down ostentatiously,
wondering as I did so how on earth I should get
out of the hole into which circumstances were thrusting me
deeper and deeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that moment, as luck would have it, two West Australians
of the 4th Regiment M.I. turned up, and, leaving them to collect
the arms of which such careful note had been made, and to eat
the remnants of my unfinished meal I mounted to ride off in quest
of their main body, taking care, however, to command proper
protection for the house in which I had been so hospitably
entertained. ‘Well played,’ said one, with much outward show of
respect, as he produced a bottle of brandy from the ample
pocket of his ‘coat British warm,’ and offered me a nip. I saw
that he, at any rate, understood the game. At Eikenhof Drift I
found the main body which turned out to be no more than a
patrol. Its appearance drew fire from the Boers, who were
apparently holding that road into Johannesburg strongly. They
began to show in groups of twenty and thirty on kopjes where
no sign of them had been seen before, and were evidently meditating
a movement by which the drift might have been outflanked.
To prevent this Major Pilkington, who was in
command, detached some men from his scanty force to hold two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>smaller fords, and in a short time there were several casualties
from rifle fire at short range. Just then we could hear the roar
of guns where General Ian Hamilton was attacking miles away
on the left. Hard pressed, yet determined to hold on where he
was, Major Pilkington had not a galloper whom he could send
with a message to his divisional General, Pole-Carew. I volunteered
to carry it, and started for a ride of twenty miles across
unknown country, making sure that I should hit off some column
within that distance. But all the troops under the immediate
command of Lord Roberts had been following the line of railway—where
their front was cleared by the 8th Mounted Infantry, with
which were Lumsden’s Horse and other regiments of Colonel
Henry’s brigade—in a turning movement, the extent of which
will be appreciated after perusal of the preceding narrative.
I had ridden a distance that would have measured nearly thirty
miles from point to point without seeing more than a small
patrol of British troops. That night, or early the next morning,
when Major Pilkington had withdrawn his small force, a thousand
Free State Boers crossed Eikenhof Drift and got in rear of the
British columns to rejoin De Wet. Meanwhile, with French or
Hamilton on the west, and in advance of the main body on the
east, deeds were being done that sealed the fate of Johannesburg
and Pretoria. Lumsden’s Horse took a full share of honours
that day, though their Colonel does not descant upon these at
great length in his official report, but contents himself with the
following record:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the 29th we marched at 5.30, expecting to arrive after ten miles at
Natal Spruit, where fighting was certain. Our maps and information
were, however, wrong, for we found ourselves most unexpectedly in sight
of the place with the smoke of the train leaving the station.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were sent to endeavour to cut it off as it wound about the
kopjes, and had a very exciting gallop of three miles, blowing up the
railway behind the train. Again we pushed on to try and cut her off at
the next big bend, but again were too late, and ran into the fire of a party
covering the retreat of the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>We then took up a position commanding the railroad, while under
Colonel Ross’s orders a party of five men was sent to block the line at
any cost. This very dangerous task was given to Lieutenant Pugh and
the undermentioned men, who carried it out with great determination
and coolness: Privates Turner, Were, Dagge, and Parks.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>An officer of high rank, whose opportunities of knowing what
happened give especial value to his testimony, says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On May 29 the 8th Mounted Infantry were ordered to move from
Klip Drift to cut the Natal Railway line, the Springs line (the main line
north of Elandsfontein), and the telegraph wires at important points.
When near the junction of Natal and Free State lines we saw a train-load
of burghers from Natal passing northwards to where, beyond the
junction, the railway runs from a broad valley into one of several converging
kopjes through a deep cutting in the steep and rugged hillside.
With the object of heading off that train as it slackened speed on a stiff
gradient, Lumsden’s Horse made a great gallop up the valley towards a
point where it narrows to a neck, from which the hills rise abruptly on
each side. Their course for two or three miles was over rough ground
parallel to the railway and nearly midway between it and a branch of
Natal Spruit. They were unable, however, to arrive in time, and the
Boers, detraining, occupied a kopje just above the railway cutting, the
gorge and banks of which they could command from the ridge above and
from a ganger’s hut, which they also held in force. Thus they had the
railway between them and Lumsden’s Horse, and seemed in a good position
for sweeping all approaches to it by an effective rifle fire. Lumsden’s
Horse dismounted in the hollow and advanced against that kopje.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, however, necessary to destroy the line, and the Engineer
officer who accompanied the force for the purpose of blowing up the line
was not handy. Lieutenant Pugh, with four men, then volunteered to get
into the cutting at its deepest point and either block or break it. As the
Boers were holding the ganger’s hut close to this point, it was a warm
corner! However, Pugh and his party reached the line. The four men
covered his further advance from the edge of the embankment whilst he
descended into the cutting. Having nothing wherewith to break the line,
he effectually blocked it with a number of huge boulders—quite sufficient
to stop any train passing through. This occupied some time, and his
covering party were pretty busy with the Boers at the hut, who were
at first inclined to run in on him. But as one or two of them paid
dearly for their temerity, their efforts ceased, so that Pugh and his party
were enabled to retreat from their little picnic without loss. Pugh is
now a D.S.O.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long and hard day that 29th of May; the 8th Mounted
Infantry were under fire from 7 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> till 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Lumsden’s Horse were
among the <em>few</em> troops in at the finish on the hill north of Elandsfontein,
where the parting duel was fought with the Boers as they retreated.
All the lines were cut. The consequent bag was fourteen engines and
over 400 waggons—not a bad day’s work. Even Lord Kitchener is
reported to have ‘smiled’ when he heard the news.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This incident is described with further detail in a private
letter by Lieutenant Pugh, who, modestly minimising his own
share in a very hazardous enterprise, writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday our orders were to take Elandsfontein, cut the wires and
blow up the railway, and to do the same at Germiston. The first excitement
began at Elsburg, where we saw a train going out of the station.
Seeing it was on the move, we sent some men to try to cut it off, but
it went back up an angle like the Darjiling train. There was another
angle, and we galloped about three miles to that part, but the train was
too fast and went round a kopje, where its occupants evidently got out
and opened fire on us. If we had known the line we would have got
that train easily by going to the
left instead of to the right. While
we were dismounted and firing an
order came for six men to rush for
the line and try to block it. The
Colonel passed on for the six men
at the end to go. It happened to
be partly my section and partly
No. 4. One man could not find
his horse, so I went off with four
men and galloped right up to the
railway and under the embankment.
It was held by a fairly
strong picket, who luckily did not
fire till we were under cover. I put
two men on to fire at that picket,
of which three were hit—the range
was only about fifty yards—and the
other two on to about 100 on our
left front 200 or 300 yards off.
We were also fired at from a kopje
on our right. The picket presently cleared, and I made a rush for the
line: it was in a cutting and out of the fire. I rolled some boulders on
the lines, and on getting back found a pretty hot fire had opened on us
from behind: it turned out to be one of our own Maxims. We mounted
and galloped back without a scratch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Ross’s orders then were to push on and support the 4th
Mounted Infantry, who held a kopje on our right. Here we lay for two
hours, our position overlooking the Boksburg railway station, supported
by two Colt guns from Ross’s Battery, which kept up a steady fire in
answer to the enemy’s shells and bullets until their retirement. We then
continued the turning movement to the right and took possession of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>station, halting there for a few minutes to re-form, while the Royal Engineer
Company attached to us for the purpose blew up the line at this point.
One of our sailors, Private Dexter, swarming up the telegraph post, cut
all communication with Springs. At the time we and a company of
Compton’s Horse were the only troops up, and, being reinforced by two
companies of the 4th Mounted Infantry, which were placed under my
orders, we were told to proceed with all speed due west to blow up the
Pretoria line, which we should find
four miles on. We succeeded in
doing this, but too late to cut off one
train, which just evaded us, our
horses being too done to go faster
than a modest trot. We again
halted a few minutes, facing a long
kopje in front of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden adds:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>While the Royal Engineer
Company were busy blowing up the
railway at this point, Captain
Rutherfoord on the left, with our
scouts, with his usual keenness soon
came in touch with those of the
enemy, and a brisk fire ensued on
both sides, Captain Rutherfoord
holding his position until I was able
to reinforce him on his right flank.
Colonel Ross soon hurried up further
reinforcements on his left, which
enabled us to hold the kopje and
forced the enemy to fall back on
the convoy they were covering. As
night was approaching, pursuit with
our tired horses was utterly hopeless,
and we were ordered to move
to our left and encamp at Germiston, which lay in the hollow behind us.
This, being the junction of railway lines that branch off in several directions,
was the key of the Boer position. Our day’s movements had,
however, been very successful, and Colonel Henry issued a brigade order
next morning saying he had been congratulated by the Commander-in-Chief
on the day’s work; while Colonel Ross was also congratulated on
the prominent part taken by his corps, which resulted in the capture of
fourteen engines and a large quantity of rolling-stock. This was very
pleasant news to us, but the work was telling its tale on the horses, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>were dead beat and fast tumbling to pieces from overwork and want of
food. Our casualty was fortunately only one during the day—namely,
Private J.D. Bewsher, who was shot through the knee while we were
engaging the enemy opposite Boksburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the pace we had travelled and the hilly nature of the country,
our Maxim gun under Captain Holmes, with its escort, had not come into
camp when we retired to bed. The men, as on many previous occasions,
had to turn in without food, and their horses were in the same plight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Describing Trooper Preston’s
adventurous ride with despatches
and his readiness of resource in
a difficult situation, another
correspondent writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Eight men of Lumsden’s Horse
in charge of Sergeant Macnamara
were sent out in a big patrol under
Captain Harris, 1st West Riding
M.I., with orders to take the
Johannesburg Waterworks. Captain
Harris paraded his sixty men, and
chose two of Lumsden’s Horse as
his orderlies. We then rode down
the kopjes to the plain below,
Compton’s Horse firing over our
heads at the Boers all the time.
As we went down we met Trooper Elwes, No. 2 Section, B Company,
being brought in wounded through the ankle when on patrol with
Lieutenant Pugh. About a mile away there was a farmhouse under the
kopje which was held by the Boers; some Australians with us rushed
the place, and captured three Boers and a waggon of ammunition. After
marching about an hour, firing every now and then and being fired at, we
got to the Waterworks on a hill towering above Johannesburg. The fort
is on another hill half a mile away. It seemed as if trenches had been
dug for us round the Waterworks, high banks of gravel perfectly protecting
us. Trooper Preston, of Lumsden’s Horse, was sent back to
Germiston with a despatch saying the Waterworks were occupied; he
was to make the shortest possible cut, and gallop all the way. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>orderly had a very exciting adventure. His shortest road lay through
the outskirts of Johannesburg. When riding through these streets he
saw several Boers peeping out of their houses, and at one place they
actually tried to stop him. He galloped through them, however; they then
shouted out to know if the English were in Johannesburg yet, and he
answered that they were, knowing that if he said no he would as likely
as not be shot at. They then asked where he was going to, and he said
Pretoria. Thus it was that a man of Lumsden’s Horse was the first, or one
of the first, to enter Johannesburg. A little further the orderly met two
Kaffirs who could talk English, and who told him that among the rocks
on a small kopje on the left of the road was an armed Boer waiting to
shoot him. The orderly was puzzled what to do, as he could see no Boer
behind the rocks; however, he dismounted and advanced on foot towards
the kopje, leading his horse behind him. Having got within speaking
distance of the rocks and still seeing no Boer, he put his rifle to his
shoulder and pointed it at the biggest rock, shouting out, ‘Hands up, or I
fire!’ Immediately two arms were seen above the rock, the order ‘Hold up
your rifle’ was obeyed at once, and the orderly found he had captured the
Boer. About a mile further on he met some Australians, and having to
gallop with the despatch he handed the prisoner over to them, taking
with him the rifle and ammunition. Alas! at the door of the Colonel’s
tent whom should he meet but Lord Kitchener himself, who, seeing the
orderly had two rifles, commandeered one. Meanwhile the Boers kept
up a continuous fire at the Waterworks. However, several Englishmen
and young ladies had climbed up the hill at the back and
brought food and drink for the first of their countrymen whom they had
seen—several of them, while Tommy ate and drank, firing away with the
soldiers’ rifles at the fort. In the evening Preston brought the message
to retire to camp, which was done in a very orderly fashion, the patrol
arriving back soon after dark with the total casualties of three men
wounded, having spent the most or one of the most exciting and agreeable
days in the whole campaign.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden describes other incidents in the following
passage:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>A party of West Riding Regiment’s Mounted Infantry scouting on
our left did not get off so easily, for seeing some men in khaki and
helmets to their front they mistook them for friends, and, getting within
speaking distance, were much surprised to find their morning’s greetings
met with a summons to surrender. Their immediate attempt
at flight resulted in two casualties—one wounded and taken prisoner,
the other, although wounded, getting back to camp. Firing then
became general on our right, where the 3rd Cavalry Brigade was on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>outpost duty, and we were hastily summoned to saddle up and reinforce
them. We arrived in time to witness an artillery duel, the Boers
retiring slowly under the fire of the Cavalry pom-poms. The morning’s
work, however, resulted badly for them, they having had sixteen casualties,
which were attended to by our medical officer, Captain Powell, who
was luckily on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>We then returned to camp, and shortly afterwards Captain Holmes
came in with his Maxim gun, reporting that he had lost two of his
scouting party, Privates Cary-Barnard and G.I. Watson, whom he had
sent out in advance while journeying to rejoin us in the early morning.
A few hours afterwards the missing men came into camp, stating that
having been informed that our men were in front they had ridden
confidingly into a body of about fifty men dressed like our own troops in
khaki, thinking they were friends, but were suddenly disillusioned by
being ordered to surrender. Under the conditions attempting to escape
on their worn-out horses was out of the question, and they had no option
but to deliver up their arms. They were cross-questioned as to our
strength and the likely duration of the war. Private Watson, in reply
to the latter question, told the General that he considered fighting would
be over in a few days, a reply that seemed to cause much amusement.
They were then offered the choice of remaining as prisoners or giving
their word of honour that they would fight no more during this war.
They chose the latter, thinking the end was very near.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, June 1, our orders were to march on Johannesburg,
six miles distant, which we reached unopposed in time to see the Union
Jack hoisted over the Fort, which had been divested of all its guns
except a few rendered useless. We then marched some five miles north
of the city, and camped for two days. On the morning of the 3rd we
marched twelve miles towards Pretoria, meeting no resistance, but again
losing touch with our Maxim, which, being unable to follow us across
country, had to stick to the road, and which we were destined not to
see for several days.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>So Lumsden’s Horse had gratified one desire on which their
hearts were set for many months. Their brigade had led the
fighting line practically into Johannesburg, and when the Union
Jack was hoisted over its public buildings they cared nothing
for the ceremonial parades, but were only anxious to take the
lead again in a march on Pretoria. With soldier-like brevity
Colonel Lumsden’s chronicle sums up the operations of an
eventful day:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On June 4 we advanced to Six Mile Spruit, again being the foremost
corps of the leading brigade, all anticipating a heavy fight in front of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>us, as the spruit was said to be our enemy’s last position and likely
therefore to be desperately contested. These prognostications were not,
however, realised. Careful reconnaissance showed that there were no
Boers at the spruit. We then proceeded leisurely up the chain of hills
beyond it, concluding they were not held, but with every precaution
against the unexpected. It was not until midday that we came in touch
with the enemy, who opened on the 4th Mounted Infantry on our right
with shell fire. We were then pushed forward to take a commanding
kopje, and got a smart peppering from a few snipers hidden in the rocks
on our left flank, but had no casualties, though the bullets were falling
thickly among us as we crossed the open.</p>

<p class='c000'>It now became evident that the enemy’s main position was on our
left, and I was ordered to occupy a ridge about one mile distant in that
direction, opposite a steep kopje about 1,000 yards off held by the Boers.
Here they were beautifully entrenched and kept up a steady fire on our
line, which we returned with interest, until aid arrived in the shape of
three fifteen-pounders on the right, two pom-poms on our left, and three
Colt guns in the centre. These searched the ridge for some hours
without dislodging the Boers, whose trenches must have been admirably
constructed, as a move on our part from one rock to another was sufficient
to draw a hail of bullets, while we were unable to spot a single Boer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Private Charles E. Stuart was wounded by a bullet through
the ankle, but was unable to be removed from the firing line until the fire
slackened late in the afternoon, when a kind friend carried him down on
his back to the ambulance tonga at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the enemy’s fire began to dwindle, and eventually
ceased altogether, and just as we meditated leaving our ridge to cross
over to theirs our Infantry became visible, advancing from westward
along the ridge which the enemy had occupied, while to our right front,
some two miles off, more British Infantry appeared on the sky line,
showing that the Boer position had been quitted. At this period our
Brigadier’s orders came for us to retire from the kopje and make our
bivouac for the night somewhere on the plain below.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 5 was the day on which we reached the goal we had been
struggling for. Pretoria at last, not fighting our way in, as anticipated
by everybody, but forming a peaceful procession, with our baggage
behind us, news having arrived that the Governor had surrendered the
town late the previous night.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were not allowed to halt, but just passed through the city and out
to Irene, a station ten miles south of Pretoria and on the Johannesburg
line, which we at present occupy, the whole corps protecting the rail from
Pretoria to Johannesburg.</p>

  <h2 id='chap13' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <span class='small'><em>ON LINES OF COMMUNICATION AT IRENE, KALFONTEIN,<br /> ZURFONTEIN, AND SPRINGS—THE PRETORIA PAPER-CHASE</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That march through Pretoria, marked by none of the pomp and
pageantry which imagination conjures up as essential features of
a great triumph, must have seemed a lame and impotent conclusion
to the stirring drama of real life in which Lumsden’s
Horse had played their manful part, cheered always by the prospect
of a glorious reward for all their struggles, hardships, and
sacrifices in the final downfall of Boer power when the Transvaal
capital should be in our hands. They were not the only
people who entertained such sanguine hopes and felt proportionally
disappointed at the inadequate realisation. For nearly
every soldier at that time in South Africa, from Lord Roberts
downwards, Pretoria had been the goal, and its conquest the
climax beyond which no operations of serious importance could
possibly be called for. Few people, if any, realised then how little
value Boers attach to great towns as strategical bases. With the
capture of Johannesburg and Pretoria we had theoretically all
their arsenals and main lines of communication in our hands, and
according to all hard-and-fast rules of warfare the campaign
should have ended then. That impression was certainly strong
on the Commander-in-Chief’s mind shortly before dusk of
June 4, when Colonel De Lisle, whose Mounted Infantry had
followed the enemy to within 2,000 yards of Pretoria, sent an
officer under a flag of truce to demand the surrender of the town.
The end might possibly have come then, if, instead of waiting
five hours for a reply to that summons and seven hours longer
for the unconditional surrender which Lord Roberts insisted upon
when Commandant-General Botha’s tardy message reached him,
we had risked everything in a night attack on the town. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>at dawn the next morning Botha sent a simple message to say
that he was not prepared to defend Pretoria further, and therefore
he entrusted the women, children, and property to his
enemy’s protection. In other words, we were quite at liberty to
march into a town from which every fighting commando, all
treasure, and nearly every munition of war had by that time
been safely removed. One big gun was still in the station on a
train that waited to take British prisoners away, but they had
risen in mutiny at the last moment and refused to go, wherefore
the train went without them, its movements being hastened by
the sight of British troops coming over the hills. To Colonel
Henry’s Mounted Infantry, of which Lumsden’s Horse formed a
part, was given the honour of being first to enter Pretoria by the
Rustenburg Road, as the Guards Brigade of General Pole-Carew’s
division marched in on another side, without firing a shot. So
the goal was reached; but we found it to all intents and purposes
a hollow triumph. There had been no surrender of the Boer
army or of anything that could weaken its power for further
resistance. The cage was in our hands, but the hawk had gone
with wings unpinioned. Every soldier probably felt, as Lumsden’s
Horse did, that any show of triumph would have been out of
place in the circumstances. They took no part even in the
ceremonial parade when Lord Roberts made his formal entry
and the Union Jack was hoisted on the Raadzaal that afternoon,
but had at least the satisfaction of knowing that their services of
the previous day were appreciated by the Commander-in-Chief,
who, in his despatches, wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>I marched with Henry’s Mounted Infantry, four companies Imperial
Yeomanry, Pole-Carew’s division, Maxwell’s brigade, and the naval and
siege guns, to Six-mile Spruit, both banks of which were occupied by the
enemy. The Boers were quickly dislodged from the south bank by the
Mounted Infantry and Imperial Yeomanry, and pursued for nearly a
mile, when our troops came under artillery fire. The enemy then moved
along a series of ridges parallel to our main line of advance, with the
object of turning our left flank; but in this they were checked by
the Mounted Infantry and Imperial Yeomanry, supported by Maxwell’s
brigade.</p>

    <div>INVALIDED HOME AFTER THE SURRENDER OF PRETORIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that Louis Botha, with all the main body of Boers,
had retired eastward, Lord Roberts realised the importance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>making his line of communications secure in that direction, and
he therefore paid a high compliment to the troops under Colonel
Ross in selecting them for that duty. A few days after taking
up the positions assigned to him, Colonel Lumsden wrote from
Irene a letter in which he expressed his opinion of the work that
had been done by all ranks in the corps under his command:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We have been told off to hold the line of communications from
Pretoria to Johannesburg, A Company and Headquarters taking the first
ten miles, B Company the second, and the remainder of the 8th Corps
in detachments all down the line. We are here for an indefinite time,
awaiting events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our Maxim gun under Captain Holmes has rejoined us here, having
been with General French’s columns.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a much needed rest for all, and especially for our horses, as they
are utterly unfit to do more than a couple of days’ hard marching, and I
can only put ninety mounted men, including officers, into the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, considering the corps landed with a full complement of 250
horses and has since received nearly 150 remounts, will give you an idea
of what we have gone through, and the wear and tear our horses have had
through hard marching and short feeding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking it as a whole, officers and men have kept excellent health, the
only prevalent disease being dysentery. The days are bright and sunny,
without being hot; at times it is even cold. The nights, however, are
always bitterly cold, and it is quite a usual occurrence, on awaking, to
find the grass covered with frost and the water in the hand-basin frozen
over. This will give you some idea of the pleasure of sleeping out with
only the sky for a roof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our total casualties have amounted to twenty-five—just ten per cent.
of the force we landed with, and a very large proportion of our ordinary
fighting strength, considering that the most we have ever put in the field
was 186, and we are now reduced to under a hundred mounted men.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have heard of the release of our prisoners, and expect them to join
us in a few days. Our only casualties in this shape were the seven taken
on April 30 at Ospruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot say too much in praise of the conduct of my officers and
men from first to last, under many hardships and in very trying circumstances,
and I feel sure they have gained a name for themselves
which their many friends both in England and in India have just cause
to be proud of.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am confident that my meed of praise will be fully endorsed by
those under whom I and my corps have had the honour to serve.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is considered that the war is virtually over, and, at any rate, I
fancy all Volunteer corps will be disbanded within a short time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>I have kept our accounts as nearly as possible up to date, but we
are unaware if any pay already claimed has yet been placed to our credit
in Cape Town, and in the meantime troopers are receiving advances
through this office out of the funds brought by me from India.
Fortunately, I have been able to cash cheques in the towns we have
passed through, and I hope I may succeed in doing so at Pretoria to-morrow,
as our cash in the box is reduced to four sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have received no mails, either from England or India, for the
past six weeks, and we are all anxiously awaiting news.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Special Correspondent of the ‘Englishman,’ whose close
association with the corps in all circumstances can be traced
through every letter, does not take his banishment to lines of
communication with the Stoical philosophy that characterises
Colonel Lumsden. After the freshness of it has gone he
writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Irene—that’s where Lumsden’s Horse have been putting in time since
Lord Roberts supplanted Paul Kruger in the jurisdiction of the town
and in the hearts of the people of Pretoria. Irene is not so called
because of any resemblance it bears to the Irene of the classics. For of
all the forsaken places which it has pleased Providence to dot down
on this earth of ours Irene is the most forsaken. Perhaps the Boers, in
their cunning, calculated that by giving it a name like music its reproach
in the land might be less. The predominating feature of the scenery in
Irene is the railway. That, with rare persistence for a Transvaal railway,
runs right through the place in a straight line. The late Government of
this country knew a lot about railways. A crow might have done the
distance between, say, Bloemfontein and Pretoria in 250 miles, but it
takes the railway 500 miles. And each mile cost as many hundred pounds
to build. The Government fell in with the contractor’s miscalculation.
The railway is full of curves, elegant but unnecessary, and the Government—<em>garib
admi, sahib! Huzoor, bucksheesh!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Near the station stood a culvert so big that it deserved to be called a
bridge. There the Boers had placed a charge of dynamite. The dynamite
went off pop, and the bridge, the embankment, a section of the river, and a
large slice of the scenery became as naught. Then as Lord Roberts swept
north he dropped a Sapper or two—no orders, no need of any. But in
three days trains as long as Chowringhee skipped over where the bridge
had been, and only the two Sappers trembled for the safety of their bag
o’ tricks. No Tommy ever doubts the inventions of a Sapper. And,
despite the absent-mindedness attributed to him, Tommy is a man ever
suspicious of the doings of his neighbour. But everybody knows about
Sappers and their wonderful works.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Hence it was that Lumsden’s Horse went to Irene. The powers that
had newly begun to be in Pretoria said we were to do steady Horatio,
without any theatrical business, to that bridge, while the Sappers slung
things about and made it <em>pucca</em>. After three weeks of guarding this babe
of the Royal Engineers the truth dawned upon Lumsden’s Horse that
they were on lines of communication. ’Twas no place for them, thought
they, but the authorities had their own designs, and Lumsden’s Horse
were spread out to such places as Zurfontein, Kalfontein, Oliphantfontein,
Springs, &amp;c., where the railway had been foolish enough to risk itself
in the air and endanger its existence thereby, for the Boers are death and
dynamite on everything in the shape of a bridge. However, while
Lumsden’s Horse took care of those places no Boers ventured to disturb
the peace, though they played the devil with them when we had gone.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Troopers who had not been spoilt by luxurious idleness as
prisoners of war in Pretoria took a less cynical view of their
situation at Irene until the monotony of it began to depress them.
Notwithstanding their disappointment at having to leave
Pretoria behind them before they had a chance of discovering
how illusive was its outward show of plenty, they soon became
reconciled to the fate that deprived them of a share in the
garrison duties which would have seemed but a dull substitute
for the festivities and celebrations that imagination had conjured
up as a natural sequence of a triumphal entry into the Boer
capital. On discovering that the surrender of Pretoria had not
brought peace appreciably nearer, the correspondent of the
‘Indian Daily News’ wrote quite cheerfully:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We saw very little of the town, as, after waiting near the racecourse
for about two hours, we were, much to our disgust, marched off to a
station called Irene, about ten miles down the line, where we were to be
put on lines of communication. Our hopes of a bit of a spin in the town
after the toilsome march up were therefore blasted, and growling was
more or less general, naturally enough. I think our tempers were not
improved by the fact that the road out was a mass of dust, which kept
going down our throats and into our eyes till one could hardly speak or
see. Once in camp and settled down, things wore a very different appearance,
however. Irene is a nicely wooded place, with a beautiful stream
of water running just handy—in fact, a perfect camping ground; just
close by is situated the model farm of the Transvaal. The grounds are
very extensive, and fruit and vegetables of all sorts are grown. There
is also a large fenced-in enclosure, where deer, hartebeeste, and other
animals run wild. We stayed at Irene two days, and then the 8th Mounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Infantry, accompanied by three sections of B Company, went on to
Kalfontein, a station about ten miles further south, leaving A Company
and No. 3 Section B Company to garrison Irene. Arriving at Kalfontein
late in the evening, we camped about a couple of miles from the
railway station till next day, when our company moved into the station
compound. We parted with the 8th Mounted Infantry here, they being
sent to various stations down the line, and sorry we were to lose our old
friends. Kaalfontein railway station is surrounded by nice trees, under
which we kept our horses and made ourselves at home. Knowing that
this would be our station for some time, we laid in a stock of pots and
pans collected from the empty farmhouses, of which there were several
in the vicinity, and did our cooking in <em>pucca</em> style. Ducks, geese, and
turkeys, to say nothing of cocks and hens, besides our rations of mutton
and beef, kept us going merrily, and groceries, &amp;c., were obtainable from
a few storekeepers, who paid us visits once a week. It was not surprising,
therefore, that after a month of this sort of thing, with comparatively
light work, after the rough time we had been having on the
march up, the appearance of the men all round improved considerably,
chubby rosy cheeks and well-filled-out bodies taking the place of hollow
sunken-in features and more or less meagre frames. The weather,
though bitterly cold in the nights and early mornings, and very warm as
a rule during the days, was thoroughly enjoyable, and accounted in a
great measure, no doubt, for the improved state of most of the men’s
health. Our work consists in patrolling the line south of Irene, and also
the country round on every side, and we also supply men daily for observation
posts in various directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The life we lead is, for the most part, a peaceful one, though in
examining farms and scouring the country round, which we do in parties
of six, under an officer as a rule, there is always the chance of being
potted by the wily Boer. This has happened on three occasions during our
stay, our men being fired upon at close range, and having to flee for their
lives. None of us was touched, but the bullets came pretty close most
times. These small patrols, by the way, are, I think, the most unsatisfactory
part of one’s work, looked at from a personal point of view. One
stands every chance of being shot, and knows that immediately one is
fired at it is a case of turning and riding for dear life, without a chance
of retaliation, or at any rate immediate retaliation, as the Boers always
outnumber us and hold the positions on these occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the farms round about Kalfontein are unoccupied, the
farmers and their families evidently having left in haste, only carrying
away a few necessaries with them; but some of their houses have been
left in charge of the Boer Memsahibs, the Sahibs having gone on a man-shooting
expedition with the nearest commando, or, perhaps, being
Commandants themselves. A case in point is that of Commandant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Erasmus, who has a large farm about seven miles from here, where
he has left his wife and five or six comely daughters. Needless to
say, this is a favourite patrol, though the girls are shy and retiring,
and the old lady waxes very wroth when approached with a view to
doing a deal in sheep, saying she has only enough to keep herself and
family going, doubtless including papa when he pays them his periodical
visit by stealth during the night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another trooper takes up the narrative with a sigh of regret
for the things that cannot be got at Boer farms for love or
money:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We are all languishing for an iced whisky peg and a decent meal, and
often wonder whether we shall enjoy either again. Our work has
been no picnic, and, though we are all as enthusiastic over it as ever, I
must admit our experiences have been many and hard. We have
dwindled down in numbers, too, through casualties and sickness, and our
clothing is showing signs of wear and tear. The spick-and-span stage
has long since vanished, and a wash once a week is a luxury. Some had
grown quite respectable—disrespectable I might say—beards, but the
Colonel has a rooted antipathy to hirsute growth on the chin. We have
also had some changes. Trooper Percy Smith has obtained a commission
in the Berkshires, but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro tem.</em></span> is doing duty with the 8th Mounted
Infantry; Trooper Huddleston (a cousin of Lady Roberts and brother to
the E.I.R. Traffic Manager) has been appointed Assistant-Commissioner
of Police in Kroonstad, while Lieutenant Pugh fills a similar office at
Heilbron.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have been cut off from our mails for more than a month, and are
very anxious to see the letters that have accumulated somewhere for us.
Our doings, I expect, have been telegraphed to India as they occurred, for
there is a plethora of newspaper correspondents following in the wake of
the army and with Headquarters—Lionel James represents the ‘Times,’
and has been to see his Indian friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kaffir we have come in contact with here is a bad lot, and he
has harassed the Boer farmers terribly during the war, being a perfect
Pindaree in his depredations. He loots anything and everything he can
lay hands on, and shifts his allegiance from Boer to British directly our
troops enter his province. In this respect the excuse he makes is that
since the outbreak of the war the Boers have not troubled to pay their
native servants any wages, while keeping them at work as usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the Volunteers (Colonial and Imperial) receive 5<em>s.</em> and as much as
7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per day, while Kaffirs earn on an average 4<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> per mensem in
our employ. It comes a bit rough on us to find our remuneration fixed
at 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> <em>plus</em> 3<em>d.</em> for rations per diem. Considering that we mainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>exist on private purchases of stores, the want of ready money is a great
hardship. Some of our troopers have spent from 10<em>l.</em> to 20<em>l.</em> a month on
groceries and smokes since our arrival in Africa. Ten shillings for a
packet of cigarettes has often been willingly given, while nobody would
think two shillings for a loaf of bread exorbitant. The reason for
these prices is always that the Boers have commandeered all they could
lay hands on in their retreat. Since our departure from Bloemfontein we
have not seen our tents. Our nightly shelter has been the frosty canopy of
heaven, and our couch the African veldt (pronounced ‘felt’).</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>A letter to the ‘Indian Daily News’ gives some interesting
personal details:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At Irene and Kaalfontein several of our men who had been prisoners
at Pretoria and Waterval, and others who had been left behind at various
places sick, rejoined, and we were very glad to have them back among us
again. Some of our number have had their services requisitioned by
Government, among them being Lieutenant H.O. Pugh, who has been
appointed Assistant Commissioner at Heilbron; Sergeant P.P. Warburton,
Secretary to the Irish Hospital at Pretoria; Sergeant W.C. Conduit
to the Engineering Department of the railway near Johannesburg;
Private <a id='corr257.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='L.H. Cubitt (errata)'>J.E. Cubitt</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.20'><ins class='correction' title='L.H. Cubitt (errata)'>J.E. Cubitt</ins></a></span>, Assistant Traffic Manager on the railway at Johannesburg;
Private F.M. Clifford, Mounted Orderly to General Ian
Hamilton; Private Huddleston, Assistant Commissioner at Kroonstad;
and Private Firth, to the Financial Department at Pretoria. Sergeant
D.S. Fraser was also appointed to the Financial Department at Pretoria,
and worked there for about a month, but has now rejoined the regiment
and resumed his duties as Paymaster; and Sergeant Thesiger and
Privates Moir-Byres, Lytle, Thelwall, and Thornton worked in the
Remount Department at Johannesburg until the Depôt there was
closed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Among those who had been prisoners from April 30 until our
entry into Pretoria, and about whose fate some doubt existed
for a time, was Trooper Clarence Walton. His gallantry in
sacrificing himself while attempting to save a wounded comrade
was mentioned by Colonel Lumsden as an act of conspicuous
devotion on a day when the corps gained high credit and a
reluctant rebuke for many brave deeds. Like others who fell
into the hands of enemies that day, he experienced nothing but
kindness from his captors. To this he bears willing testimony
in the following letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Starting from the time of our first action of April 30, when I had
the misfortune to be slightly wounded and taken prisoner, it might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>interesting to add my experience of the treatment I received to that of the
other prisoners. After our fighting line retired from my direction a Boer
came down to me and asked if I was wounded. I told him I was hit in the
foot, and he offered to take my boot and gaiter off for me, which I accepted.
He then got a small pony and helped me on, and took me to a farm about
half a mile distant, where an English doctor (on the Boer side) attended to
my case immediately, and then gave me a jolly good meal, better than I
had had for some time. The following night I was taken to Brandfort
Hospital, where I received every kindness possible, the nurses being
exceedingly attentive, and the Boers themselves, far from showing any
ill-feeling, came and talked and gave me tobacco. One lady cycled to
her home with the object of getting some books for me to read; but
unfortunately she arrived back just too late, as we were being placed in
the waggon to go to Smaldeel and entrain there for Pretoria. Lieutenant
Crane, who was also a prisoner, travelled most of the way in the same
waggons and train as myself. He was kind enough to allow me to share
the little tobacco he had got, for which I was exceedingly grateful. After
reaching Pretoria I was handed over to our own people at the hospital
on the racecourse, where, although I did not have quite such a comfortable
time as I had had with the Boer ambulances, I had nothing to complain
of, as the British residents at Pretoria did everything they could
for us, and we have to thank them for all the little luxuries they gave us.
The food we received from the Boers was sufficient to keep one alive, and
that is about all.</p>

<p class='c000'>After Pretoria was taken I found myself a prisoner of the R.A.M.C.,
which I found to be very irksome, although at Pretoria the Major
in charge allowed us our liberty to a great extent. When I got to
Bloemfontein I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Roe, late doctor in
Assam, who treated Saunders and myself with great kindness, and did
everything he could to make us comfortable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Life at Irene was not all unpleasant. Several lively incidents
brightened existence there, and some reflex of them comes to us
through the cheery words of Captain Neville Taylor, whose
arduous duties as Adjutant did not prevent him from garnering
a fund of merry anecdotes. Here is one:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>After Pretoria had been taken A Company and Headquarters remained
at Irene, and B Company went to Kalfontein, ten miles south on the
line. The duties at both places were similar, in that they had to patrol
the line and the neighbourhood. One of the Irene regular patrols was to
Pretoria and back daily.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one of the usual patrols into that town Captain Rutherfoord passed
a German ambulance proceeding south, who explained that they had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>allowed to do so, but carried no pass. Arriving at Pretoria, he reported
the fact to the authorities, and also that he had stopped the ambulance
until he could get orders concerning it. On inquiry, having ascertained
that nothing was known about it, he obtained a letter to the Commandant
at Irene, who was told to ascertain that the ambulance people were
carrying no papers for the use of the enemy, and, if satisfied, to allow
them to proceed. The Commandant, being a man of high ideals, did not
see his way to thoroughly searching the ambulance, which contained
four German nurses, in addition to the four doctors, and he therefore
allowed them to pass on having taken the senior doctor’s word of
honour that they had with them nothing of any use to the enemy in the
way of papers. The ambulance then went on its way, but stopped the
night at Kalfontein, ten miles beyond Irene. In the evening a wire
came to us for an officer’s patrol to bring all those people back to Pretoria.
Captain Rutherfoord was accordingly sent to Kalfontein for the purpose,
and returned in the evening with the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden and all of us felt so sorry for the prisoners that we
decided to ask them to dinner, which invitation being accepted, in due
course we all sat down together in our little mess-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>During our stay at Irene, as it was bitterly cold, we had run up a
small hut: walls of piled-up stones, a tin roof, and a most cunningly
contrived fireplace which did not smoke. We decorated the place with
flowers, had a tip-top dinner, and drank <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>crème de menthe</em></span> as our only
beverage. The dinner went off in the wonderful way dinners do. None
of us could talk German, and none of them English, and yet we conversed
freely and had the greatest fun. The show concluded with songs, and the
last remembrance I have of it was that the Colonel and the prettiest
‘sister’ were taking down one another’s addresses and betting gloves about
something in the quietest corner. Rutherfoord had been hiding as much
as possible, as he felt himself to blame for being the cause of all their
trouble, but we gave him away at the end, and though they all pretended
to be very angry with him, we unanimously allowed that he had beaten
all but the Colonel in winning the favours of the fair sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we escorted them back to their caravan and said
good-night, first of all pointing out that a sentry was posted over them,
with orders to shoot at sight if anyone left the waggons during the night.
They started for Pretoria at daybreak, but most of the officers were there
to see them off, while one met them a few miles up the road. The Colonel
was late for breakfast that morning. We heard afterwards that on arrival
at Pretoria they were searched, and the result was that the doctors went
to gaol, and the dear ladies were sent under supervision out of the country.
We all, however, are quite certain that they were innocent victims of
Boer duplicity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Another story is very characteristic of Tommy’s smartness:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At one of the camps—I think Elandsfontein—a party of us got leave
to go into the town for dinner. We had come in late, and either had not
been given or had forgotten the countersign. Near the town we came
upon a sentry, who challenged in the usual way, and who let us through
after making certain that we were officers of Lumsden’s Horse. After
going a few yards we heard him say to his pal that it was all right, as we
were only ‘some of those d——d Volunteers,’ this being meant in all
politeness and only Tommy’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>patois</em></span>. One officer of ours, however, half-jokingly
threatened to report him if he talked like that again. After a
good dinner we were returning to camp and came upon the same sentry.
‘Halt! Who goes there?’ ‘Friend.’ ‘Advance one and give the
countersign.’ One officer, advancing, said, ‘D——d Volunteer.’ Tommy
shouldered with a slap and roared out, ‘Pass, D——d Volunteer, and all’s
well!’ He had the best of us, and we laughed as much as the guard.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>About this time the Boers in Pretoria were also making
merry over an incident associated with countersigns in which one
who played a sentry’s part had the laugh on his side at the
expense of British officers. It happened at a crisis when Botha
was known to have secret emissaries in the capital warning him
of every preparation for a fresh movement, and it illustrates
perfectly the aptitude of Boers as spies, and the easy-going inefficiency
of our own precaution against traitors. A young Boer,
speaking English fluently, came from Botha’s force just after
Lord Roberts was supposed to have dispersed it in the neighbourhood
of Diamond Hill. He reached our outposts not far
from the limits patrolled by Lumsden’s Horse, and, being armed
with one of the passes that have been lavishly distributed and
frequently abused, he had no difficulty in getting through the
British lines. Once inside them, he was free to move about
anywhere and ascertain that nearly all available troops, except
one division, had been withdrawn from Pretoria for concentration
elsewhere. He even loitered about to hear the talk at a club
frequented by officers and by ‘friendly’ civilians, whose privileges
of membership nobody assumed the right to question. There and
in hotel halls or billiard-rooms, where officers, regardless of
attentive listeners, incautiously spoke of their own probable
movements, this young Boer picked up much entertaining
gossip and useful information. But he also learned, to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>dismay, that nobody could move about the town or leave it after
nightfall without the countersign. His idea was to get out
again under cover of darkness, with all the news that he could
gather for General Botha, but he heard that provisional police
would by that time be patrolling all the streets, alert and zealous
in the performance of their new duties, and also that every outlet
by which a horseman could pass would have double sentries
posted after sunset. A wary Boer never tries rash experiments
if he can avoid them, and this young man, having no unpatriotic
wish to run his head into a noose, adopted other measures.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going to a friend’s house, in which some British uniforms
were kept as trophies until the police discovered and appropriated
them, he dressed in khaki, donned a greatcoat, and armed
himself with a Mauser carbine. All this may seem impossible
in a town under martial law, but arms and ammunition were
found in private houses long after the date of this incident, and
nobody ever heard of exemplary punishment being meted out to
offenders, who generally got off scot free on a plea of ignorance.
At any rate, the young Boer, thus equipped to counterfeit a
provisional policeman, sallied forth at night, when a high collar,
turned well up for protection against the icy north wind, and a
hat slouched over the eyes, would not have attracted any
attention. Making use of mental notes previously taken, he
placed himself near the corner of a street so much frequented by
officers on their way to or from the club that special police
seldom troubled to look after it. There he had not long to wait
for a chance of challenging, and in response the countersign was
given as a matter of course without the least suspicion. Safe
in the possession of this password, the ingenious young Boer
mounted his horse, and, claiming to be the bearer of despatches,
rode past our outlying pickets and off into the darkness on his
way to the nearest Boer commando. Some officers of Lumsden’s
Horse were in the Pretoria Club that night, but it was not they
who gave away the countersign. Occasional visits to Pretoria
in the vain hope of finding that some articles of luxury or much-needed
outfit could be bought there became great events in the
lives of both officers and men during their banishment to lines
of communication. Somehow a goodly number of them, for
whom sport was an irresistible attraction, managed to assemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>on ground a mile outside the racecourse when three score of
competitors started for the first military steeplechase ever ridden
near Pretoria. After this event Colonel Lumsden wrote with
pardonable pride:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Beharis will be pleased to hear that Captain Rutherfoord, of ours, won
the first paper-chase in Pretoria. There were sixty starters over a stiff
country, with the result that grief was plentiful.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>But that view of the result, though entertained by nearly
every spectator who was near enough to watch an exciting finish,
did not commend itself to the official whose decision none could
question. How it all came about may be told by an eye-witness,
who was also a competitor until, finding himself hopelessly
out of the race, he took to ‘skirting,’ and finally joined a crowd
of onlookers at the winning-post.</p>

<p class='c000'>The German Staff officer who said that English soldiers went
into a fight as if it were sport and took their sport seriously as
training for battle, must have been thinking of some scene like
that in which British officers and Volunteers of all ranks figured
on Pretoria Racecourse that last Saturday in June 1900. There
we were in the midst of war with an active enemy not many
miles off, yet nobody seemed to concern himself much about
what the Boers might be doing at that moment. All were intent
upon the important business in hand. A paper-chase had to be
run, and every man meant to do his best, whether mounted on a
Basuto pony that had never jumped any obstacle more formidable
than a boggy spruit before, or on a raking Waler or clever
English hunter. Lord Roberts had given permission for a paper-chase
and theoretically the sport took that form. There were no
prizes for winners, no clerk of the scales, no weighing-in, no
penalties for infringement of Hunt Club rules. All who cared to
start might enjoy that privilege. But practically the thing
resolved itself into a steeple-chase under regulations that forbade
riding from point to point at discretion; a course being marked
by flags round which every starter was compelled to go or lose
his chance of distinction. Paper-hunting would have been
child’s play in a country like this unless it had led us over rough
kopjes and away across the veldt, where there might have been a
chance of Boer patrols chipping in. So to add some touch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>excitement, and the spice of danger, without which no British
sport is worthy of that name, artificial fences were made more
difficult to negotiate than torrent-filled spruits or boggy water-courses.
Two stone walls enclosing a mealie patch came handy,
and suggested themselves as most appropriate for a start where
spectators might see some fun at the outset if veldt ponies tried
to tumble over, as they generally do, without jumping. A run
without hound-music as an accompaniment did not commend
itself to the immortal Jorrocks, whose eulogy of ‘’unting, the
image of war without its guilt and only 25 per cent. of its
danger,’ would have been considerably
modified in application
to such sport as ours of
that day, if that genial M.F.H.
could have seen the horses some
men chose to risk their necks
on. They were of all sizes,
shapes, and breeds. As for the
fences, an Irish hunter would
have larked over every one in
his stride; but it is quite another
thing with horses that
have never been trained to leap.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Pretoria did not give itself
away all at once to the temptations
of a novel spectacle; but
there were ladies in carriages
among the little crowd of sightseers,
and some stolid burghers
looked on with approval, while others took part in the chase, for
Boers have a bond of sympathy with us in love of horse-racing
and field sports. The Commander-in-Chief came, sitting his
shapely chestnut with a firmer and more workmanlike ease than
half the horsemen present could boast of, and looking as if he
could still show them all the way over a stiff hunting country.
His appearance at the starting-point was a signal for marshalling
the forces into line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a Staff officer gave the word to go, and away went
the motley field, more than half a hundred strong, spurring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>hustling, charging like a Cavalry squadron for all they were
worth. A light-weight, who served with distinction in Her
Majesty’s Navy years ago, was quickest off, and led them over
the two stone walls, closely followed by Captain Cox, of the New
South Wales Lancers. Then came the second flight, riding for
the walls knee to knee. Thanks to bold hearts and resolute
riding, they all got over. A fall in that dense formation with
another rank rushing close behind would have brought more than
one rider to unutterable grief. But the ranks began to thin
where a spruit had to be crossed, with steep banks into and out
of the drift. There the ‘Skipper’s’ pony, with speed unchecked,
gained a good lead, but he came down at the next made-up
fence and gave his rider a nasty fall. The active light-weight,
however, nipped into the saddle and went on cheery as ever.
Then in clouds of dust, through which the fences could scarcely
be seen, leggy horses and diminutive ponies rushed onward,
jostling for a lead as before. Captain McNeil, of Montmorency’s
Scouts, came down and broke his collar-bone, and Gibbs, of the
Somerset Yeomanry, falling with his horse on top of him, had two
ribs broken. But still ‘the chase went sweeping heedless by’
over a wide dug-out, with a hurdle to screen it and a trappy
ditch where the road had to be crossed. Then they spread out
to gallop over stony ground for the spruit, into which many
floundered. The pace was beginning to tell on horses out of
condition as they struggled up hill to go for a formidable bank
of sandbags topped with loose earth that had been dug out of
the ditch in front. Down-hill again to a hollow, where the little
stream meandering between boggy ground had to be crossed
three times. There several jaded steeds came to a standstill,
having shot their bolts, and only a select few went up the next
hill to the trappiest fence of all, where water flowed between deep
banks. There the ‘Skipper’ got his third fall, but he mounted
again and followed the leaders as they rounded the flag and rode
for home. Captain Cox had also been left behind, and the
running was taken up by Captain Rutherfoord, of Lumsden’s
Horse, with Major Kenna, V.C., of the 21st Lancers, in close
attendance. Flanks were heaving and pipes wheezing before
the next boulder-strewn ridge had been crossed. ‘A run is
nothing without music,’ said a subaltern as he roused his panting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>steed for another effort. He nearly blundered, as many
others did, over the next little fence, and they were being left
hopelessly behind. Kenna and Rutherfoord charged the last
stone wall side by side, and rose together at it. Rutherfoord
landed first, and had the race in hand, but, mistaking the post,
eased his horse too soon. So Kenna, V.C., got a neck ahead
in the straight run home, and thus won his right to claim the
brush or whatever may be a substitute for it in paper-chasing.
That was the official verdict, but Lumsden’s Horse still hold that
their champion was first past the post.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day a pleasant incident enlivened Colonel Lumsden’s
ordinarily uneventful round of inspections. He had been visiting
posts south of Irene, and was hurrying back to headquarters on
an affair of urgent importance, when a train stopped at one of the
sidings. Before he had time to realise that it was a special, or
to make any inquiries, the train began to move again. So he
jumped on to the nearest platform, and presently found himself
in a corridor, cleaner and more carefully looked after than any
he had seen on a Transvaal railway up to that time. Not
knowing what to make of it, and half-expecting to meet an angry
Chief of the Staff face to face, he refrained from exploring further.
Presently a lady passed and said, ‘Won’t you come in?’ Colonel
Lumsden was smoking at the time, and declined for that reason.
‘But mother wishes you to come,’ was the reply. So the gallant
Colonel yielded with ready grace, and found himself in the presence
of Lady Roberts, who, with her daughters, was on the way
to Pretoria. They were just then nearing Irene, and Colonel
Lumsden drew attention to the camp of his Indian Volunteers,
in whom he thought Lady Roberts would naturally be much
interested. To his surprise he saw a huge bonfire burning, and
in silhouette against it were the words, ‘Welcome to Lady
Roberts!’ Sergeant-Major Stephens had hit upon this happy
idea, and put it into execution just at the right moment. One
of the daughters, seeing it, said, ‘Oh, mother, there is a warm
welcome for you, at any rate!’ Lady Roberts frequently
referred to this impromptu welcome in conversation with
Colonel Lumsden afterwards, and spoke appreciatively of the
pleasure it had given her.</p>

<p class='c000'>For nearly two months—from the fall of Pretoria on June 5 to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>July 29—Lumsden’s Horse were scattered up and down the
railway lines between Pretoria and Johannesburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden gives the following official account of this
period in a letter to the executive committee of his corps:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>My headquarters are still at Irene, while my corps is stationed in
detachments along the railway from here to Springs. I am daily expecting
an order to concentrate either here or at the latter point, having
received official information that we are to be relieved by Mounted
Infantry from the Regulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond living in a constant state of alarm, standing to arms at all
hours of the night, and our patrols shooting and being shot at, there is
little or nothing of interest to record.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scouting parties have had several narrow escapes, but nothing of a
serious nature occurred until yesterday (July 13), when I heard by wire
from Captain Beresford at Springs that Private Claude F. Walton, of the
Mysore detachment, had been wounded rather severely while out on patrol
with Captain Clifford, but without, I understand, endangering his life.
The shot was fired from a farmhouse, which has since, I am glad to say,
been burnt to the ground. Two days previously, when I was on a visit to
Springs, Captain Chamney and his patrol had rather a narrow squeak, but
got safely away under a pelting fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Boer outposts are within four to five miles of our position at
Springs, where Colonel Ross and part of his corps are stationed, but they
are too weak to take the initiative.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weather is still bitterly cold at night, but the men have now had
time to rig up temporary shelters of sorts, while the detachments at
Zurfontein and Springs have been fortunate in obtaining iron-roofed
shelters to live in.</p>

<p class='c000'>I much regret to have to inform you of the death of Private
M.B. Follett, of the Mysore detachment, from enteric fever in hospital
at Johannesburg on the 7th inst., and that the undernamed have been
left at various hospitals on the march up sick, or sent down from here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some may return to headquarters, but I anticipate that most of them
will proceed to England or to India, invalided or convalescent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Follett’s brother was fortunately with him at the last, and it
is gratifying to note that the rites usually accorded to an officer were
observed at his interment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men in the attached list have mostly received their regimental pay
up to date, and I have done my best to see that any balance due to them
in this respect will be paid before they leave Cape Town.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have also given in such cases five pounds to each man for necessaries
on the voyage. This responsibility I have taken on myself, having ample
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>funds in hand, and I feel sure the committee will approve my action, more
especially as many men are utterly unable to get into communication with
their friends and are entirely without money.</p>

<p class='c000'>I understand Government intends to grant this amount to each soldier
as a war gratuity at the close of the campaign; the sums thus given will
therefore be recoverable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regimental Sergeant-Major Marsham’s friends in Behar will regret to
hear that bad luck has again overtaken him. On the way up to rejoin
after recovering from his wounds, he was so unfortunate as to be in
company with the Derbyshire Militia when they met with their disaster,
and is believed to have been taken prisoner with them. So far I have no
official communication as to this, but, not having heard from or of him,
conclude it is only too true.</p>

<p class='c000'>Private Percy Smith and Lance-Corporal Hugh Blair have received
commissions in the Regular forces and are no longer with the corps,
although the former is for a time attached to the Oxford M.I.—part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>our own regiment under Colonel Ross. Blair is among the sick men
mentioned and at present in Cape Town.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Roberts has also been good enough to grant commissions to
Private Douglas Jones—in the Army Service Corps—Privates J.A. Fraser,
Collins, T.B. Nicholson, J.S. Biscoe, and Corporal Bates. Several of
the latter are for the West India Regiments. All these remain with me
for the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Pugh and Private Huddleston have been appointed Assistant
Commissioners at Heilbron and Kroonstad respectively.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: P. Klier</em></span><br />CAPTAIN W. STEVENSON, <span class='sc'>Vet. Surg.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The names of several other applicants are still before His Excellency,
and I hope to advise you soon of their having received commissions also.
At the same time I do not expect
any of these will leave the corps
until its disbandment. Young
Maurice Clifford has been taken on
by General Ian Hamilton as orderly,
and is also likely to receive a commission,
as well as Leslie Williams,
son of the late popular Gwatkin
Williams.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Rutherfoord, Lieutenant
Crane, and Sergeant Macnamara
have been offered commissions in
the Transvaal Mounted Police, and
will probably remain in this country,
as I believe will a good many
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Stevenson is likely to
obtain an important veterinary appointment
out here, and Dr. (Captain)
Powell is also in the running
for a high medical post should he
prefer this to returning to India.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the above, added to the continued requisitions for men of my corps
for various offices, point to the esteem in which they are held by the
authorities apart from their fighting qualities. In fact, were it not for
strong remonstrances on my part to official requests, I should be in a fair
way to lose a big percentage of my men before the work for which they
came out has been completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In my previous letter I mentioned the sad plight to which our horses
had been reduced, and that at the time of writing I doubted my ability to
place ninety mounted men in the field fit for a two-days’ march. You will
now be pleased to hear that in this respect things have improved, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>I can now mount 180 officers and men on fairly serviceable animals, few,
however, remaining of our original Indian chargers. In this connection
I may also mention that out of sixty Argentine remounts received at
Kroonstad, only one is alive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now comes the important question of finance.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have been spending various sums on comforts for the men, the
largest item being 50<em>l.</em> for a much-needed supply of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men are very badly in want of clothes, especially breeches, tunics,
and boots. I have indented on the Government Stores at Bloemfontein
for a complete outfit, and hope to receive it shortly. This, of course, will
be issued to us gratis. Nothing in the shape of clothing can be got for
money.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am enclosing a statement showing roughly the financial position of
the corps. From this you will see that, provided the war is not prolonged
beyond our present anticipations, there will be an ample balance left to
admit of the payments estimated for in Calcutta.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Lumsden’s Horse found their duties on lines of communication
not all uneventful, and had on occasions some adventures more
exciting than the incidents of a patrol to Pretoria or Elandsfontein
or Johannesburg, though that had to be conducted with proper
precautions against possible surprises from Boer raiders who
were always on the prowl within a few miles of our outpost lines,
but rarely to be seen. Emboldened by the inaction of British
troops in Pretoria and by some successes which Christian De Wet
had achieved down Rodewal way, where he captured and burnt
a train containing mail-bags with precious letters for Lumsden’s
Horse, the enemy began to press on every weak point they could
find. They evinced especially a desire to get possession of the
mines near Springs, being not only bent on wanton destruction,
but also impelled thereto by the fact that Supply officers there
had been gathering stores of forage from the country round
about. Apart from its position in the centre of a district richly
mineralised, Springs was of considerable strategic importance as
a stronghold for the protection of the railway junction at Elandsfontein,
to which its commanding kopjes, if strongly held, were a
formidable flanking defence. Nothing but the belief that Botha’s
forces had been so scattered and demoralised by defeat at Diamond
Hill as to be incapable of great offensive movements could have
induced the military authorities to neglect an adequate defence of
Springs. The Boers seemed to realise its importance more than
we did, and if they had brought artillery to bear upon it the safety
of Johannesburg might have been seriously threatened. Fortunately,
however, either Botha’s irresolution or divided counsels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>among his colleagues led to the abandonment of such enterprises
after one or two attempts which were frustrated by General
Hutton and Colonel Henry, whose Mounted Infantry reconnaissances
at this juncture were characterised by great skill. Nevertheless,
some strong Boer commandos were persistent in their
attempts to get a footing at Springs, so that Lumsden’s Horse
had to reinforce other corps of the 8th Mounted Infantry and
take their full share of outpost work, in which they were
frequently harassed by the enemy. Some interesting details of
this phase are furnished by troopers whose letters were published
in the Indian newspapers. One correspondent writes to the
‘Indian Daily News,’ dating from Springs, July 14:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>You will see from the above that we have been moved again, and I
fancy we shall be kept on the go now for some time to come, as both we
and our horses have had a long rest and are quite fit again.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was rather a bore getting shifted out of our comfortable quarters at
Kalfontein, but now that the wrench is over I fancy most of us are glad
to be on the march once more, as life there was beginning to get just a
trifle monotonous and humdrum.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a week previous to our leaving Kalfontein No. 3 Section B
Company, who had been left at Irene with A Company, were sent to
garrison Zurfontein, a few miles down the line, and we joined them
there, the whole of us then marching to this place, which is the terminus
of a branch of the main line running eastward, and is situated about
twenty-five miles from Johannesburg. I should have mentioned that we
left a few of our men at Kalfontein to help to garrison the place until
further orders. We stayed at Elandsfontein and Boksburg on the way
here, and the men who had been through such exciting scenes so recently
in these places naturally took a great interest in them and ‘fought their
battles o’er again.’</p>

<p class='c000'>We have had rather an exciting time of it on two occasions since
being quartered here. On the 11th inst. we sent out a patrol of six
men under Captain Chamney, and just as they got to the top of a bit of
rising ground they found themselves within a few hundred yards of an
approaching body of the enemy, who no sooner saw our men than they
let ’em have it with their Mausers. There was nothing for it but to turn
and get away as quickly as possible, and this the patrol did, managing once
again to elude the bullets. The Boers followed, but soon gave up the
game, as it was only a few miles from the town, and they evidently did
not consider it good enough to venture too close. On getting out of range
and up to the next rise our patrol halted and sent a man back to report
matters to Colonel Ross, and, after staying out about an hour to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>if there were any more signs of the enemy, they returned to camp.
A larger patrol was sent out during the day, but saw no signs of Boers,
these gentry evidently having returned to the adjacent hills. A small
farmhouse, from behind which our men were shot at, was burnt down;
but this did not have much effect, as another of our patrols was fired on
two days afterwards near the same place, and this time we were not so
fortunate, as Private Walton, of No. 3 Section B Company, was shot
through the right thigh and got another bullet through his hat, just
shaving his skull. He managed to ride into camp with the others, but
will have a long spell in hospital, I fancy. His wound was dressed as
soon as he got into camp, and next day he was sent on to Johannesburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is one of the coldest places we have struck so far, and early
morning patrols and night pickets are consequently more unpopular than
ever. There is one great consolation, however, and that is we can get
good and cheap draught beer here; this is a luxury we have not indulged
in for ages, so, needless to say, the thirsty ones are having a great time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The special correspondent of the ‘Englishman’ treats one of
the incidents above referred to in a lighter vein:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>In the middle of July our detachment at Springs, where there had
been a good deal of desultory fighting, had some fun for their money.
They went out patrolling one day, a dozen or so strong. A farmhouse
loomed in the distance, and as the magnetic pole draws the needle so did
this innocent, nestling farm draw the patrol. If you live on biscuits for
a month you develop a craving for bread. Same with everybody, from
General down to mule-drivers. It would be side on the part of
Lumsden’s Horse to hold aloof from any popular taste, and as one leary-nosed
tea planter said he smelt dough, the patrol rode for that farmhouse,
animated by the noble sentiment that the devil might take the hindmost.
But this time the devil nearly copped the leader, for the Boers opened at
short range from stone walls near the farmhouse. A patrol’s duty being
to locate the enemy, and not to die valorously or otherwise, our men turned
tail, thought of their misdeeds, and streaked for home. Unluckily C.F.
Walton, of B Company, bestrode an Argentine which feared neither Boer
nor bullet. The brute wouldn’t budge under the fire, and Walton received
a hail of lead all to himself. One bullet struck his hat, cutting the bottom
of the crack—our squashed Cashmere ones—clean away, shedding his
hair in a way that no brushing will alter, for it shaved a line clean along
his scalp. Just as he got his horse on the move he was struck again, in
the thigh, but managed to gallop away without further mishap. Examination
proved that the bullet had gone right through the upper part of
his leg, inflicting a severe but not dangerous wound. Walton is now in
hospital and doing well.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Fuller details and a more consecutive narrative of other
events are given by a correspondent of the ‘Madras Daily Mail,’
who writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Our duties are not only to guard the station and railway line and
patrol the country, but also to furnish observation posts, whose duty it
is to report the movements of any bodies of men they may see; the
patrols also demanding the production of passes from anyone—native or
white man—whom they may meet. The Boers are not far off, and life
is not without its excitement; for on two occasions our patrols have
been fired on, once getting a particularly hot reception and being chased
for a considerable distance. One man in particular had a narrow escape
when the enemy—who were lying in wait for the patrol—suddenly
charged down over the top of a neighbouring ridge. He was in the
middle of a small copse ahead of his companions and did not see the
Boers, who galloped round on each flank of the wood, and, dismounting
just this side of it, commenced firing at the rest of the patrol. Hearing
the rifles so close, he <a id='corr273.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='attemped'>attempted</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_273.17'><ins class='correction' title='attemped'>attempted</ins></a></span> to return, and found, on getting to the
edge of the wood, that he was cut off by a line of men along a wire
fence, who fortunately were so busy firing that they did not see him.
He eventually made a dash for it from the upper end of the wood,
coming out behind the Boers and making a long detour. Of course,
directly he got clear of the wood he was seen and became a target for
all their rifles, but he got safely away.</p>

<p class='c000'>During a prolonged stay in a place like this we manage to make
ourselves very comfortable. In the vicinity of Kaalfontein the farmhouses
were for the most part deserted and had been left just as they
stood. From these farmhouses we are always allowed to help ourselves
to useful and non-valuable articles, such as cooking utensils and eatables;
so what with chickens, ducks, &amp;c., while the live-stock held out, and
most excellent mutton issued as rations, not to mention an occasional
porker (bought from the Kaffirs) or haunch of venison (shot by one of
the officers), our larder was well stocked, while extras in the way of
groceries could be obtained from an enterprising Jew storekeeper, who
would drive round with his stores. Then, too, bivouacs and shelters of
all sorts can be rigged up, and very welcome they were at the time, as
during June and the beginning of July the cold was intense.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Springs, the terminus of a branch line from Elandsfontein Junction
through Boksburg, together with four companies of the 8th Mounted
Infantry and the Canadians, we remained six days. Here the Boers
were rather closer than they had been at Kaalfontein, and it was the rule
rather than the exception for the patrols to be fired on. One morning
our patrol was shot at from a farmhouse flying a white flag, the
advance scouts being only 150 yards distant; one of them, Trooper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Walton (Mysore and Coorg Rifles), received a bullet through his thigh
and another right through the crown of his hat, actually cutting the hair
along the top of his head, but he managed to get away without further
injury. On receiving the news Colonel Ross immediately sent out a strong
patrol with a pom-pom and burnt the house to the ground, but saw nothing
of the enemy, who are always careful not to interfere with a strong
patrol, their plan being to allow a small party to approach their ambush
and then suddenly open fire, hoping to empty a few saddles. Fortunately,
however, it is not easy to hit a man on horseback at an unknown range
or else the Boers are uncommonly bad shots, for our patrols have now
been fired upon on seven or eight different occasions at comparatively
close range and only one man has been hit. One afternoon a party of Boers,
about thirty in number, were seen by the look-out man coming down to a
Kaffir kraal, about three miles out. Lumsden’s Horse were ordered to
saddle up immediately and give chase. The Boers, however, did not wait.
They had evidently come down to get mealies from the Kaffirs, as we
found some bags they had dropped in their haste.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>A TYPICAL BOER<br /><span class='small'>(<em>From a sketch by J.S. Cowen</em>)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In these operations Lumsden’s Horse learned a great deal
about the tricks and methods of Boer scouts, and soon began
to realise that these could best be met by bringing all a
shikarri’s varied experiences into play. In reality the wily
Boers do not send out patrols, according to our interpretation of
that word. When any considerable number of them are seen
together, it may be taken for granted that their scouts have
previously done all the work expected of them, or that they
are off somewhere in another direction, acting as a screen for
some more important movement. When watching a hostile
force, with a view to aggressive tactics or defensive measures,
the Boers hardly ever show themselves. If caught by chance
on the move, they either halt where they are and lie down or
steal away one by one to the nearest cover, knowing perfectly
well that any large body moving can be seen a long distance off,
while separate figures become almost invisible dots on the vast
plain and attract no attention from people whose eyesight is less
keen than a Kaffir’s. Once concealed from view, they are
careful not to show themselves again on the sky-line, or on a
sunlit slope, where their shadows would betray them. From
hunting wild game they have learned to pursue the tactics of
an antelope or a haartebeeste in eluding a vigilant enemy. As
a herd of deer, browsing peacefully in some hollow, leaves a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>trusty sentinel on the nearest hill to keep watch, so Boers tell
off one of their number for a similar duty, and he, like the
sentinel buck, remains motionless beside a tree or stone, invisible
himself, but allowing no movement on the plain to escape
his watchful eye. The man on whom this task falls is generally
a veteran trained by long experience to a knowledge of the veldt
and the habits of every being, man or beast, frequenting it. By
the actions of horses or cattle on the pastures, not less than by
the hurried movement of more timid wild animals or birds, he
knows whether they have been disturbed by anything unusual.
Then he stoops down to listen, and his ears are so sensitive by long
practice that he can distinguish the rumble of wheels or tread of
marching men miles off, though the sound comes to him no
louder than the whisper of wind among dry grass. And a bird
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>on the wing, or animal scuttling through the undergrowth, will
warn him at once of approaching foes.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN CLIFFORD</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If the Boers want to lay an ambush they do not set about
it in a clumsy fashion, but with due foresight, calculating all
the chances. Far in advance of the trap thus prepared they
will probably have posted some men among the rocks of a kopje,
or preferably in a dry donga between high banks that effectually
conceal any movement. These advanced scouts never show
themselves or fire a shot when the prey for which their comrades
are waiting approaches. They simply allow it to pass, and then
perhaps will be heard a whistle like that of some wild bird, the
lowing of cattle that cannot be seen, or other sound familiar
enough but conveying no particular meaning at the moment.
Yet in all probability it is a preconcerted signal from the foremost
scouts to others within hearing, who pass on the message, so that
every movement of the coming patrol or column is known to the
Boers waiting in ambush for it. Thus many mishaps have
occurred in a way that nobody could account for, and by practising
similar methods Lumsden’s Horse at length became a match
for their enemy at the same game. Other lessons than those
learned at Springs were, however, needed to perfect them in the
craft on which the safety of an army may sometimes depend.
One such experience fell to their share in a reconnaissance
towards Crocodile River, which Colonel Lumsden describes in a
letter to the executive committee of Lumsden’s Horse:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>A few days after the despatch of my previous letter, Colonel Ross,
with a detachment of my own corps and the greater part of the 8th
Mounted Infantry, collected at Irene under instructions to proceed to
Pretoria. While we were still in camp there orders came from headquarters
to patrol the country to the west and north-west as far as the
Crocodile River. On receiving the above orders, Colonel Ross, accompanied
by myself, Captain Taylor, and a small patrol of the Oxfords under
Lieut. Percy Smith, went out to reconnoitre the country. Captain
Clifford, of ours, had already proceeded early in the day (July 20) with a
patrol of fifteen men in the same direction. Overtaking this party about
noon, Colonel Ross ordered Captain Clifford to push on and ascertain that
the ground was clear of the enemy as far as the river. Colonel Ross’s party
then returned to Irene. Late in the evening Captain Clifford’s patrol came
back and reported that his party had been ambuscaded before reaching
the river, and had had to make the best of their way out of a tight place on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>jaded horses at the best speed they could, leaving two of their number,
Privates Bearne and Cayley, in the hands of the enemy. Captain Clifford
estimated the enemy’s strength at 300, and reported that as far as he
could ascertain they were laagered in a strong natural position near Six
Mile Spruit, commanding a perfect view of its valley. Not being quite
satisfied with the information, Colonel Ross ordered him to proceed again
next day with a patrol of thirty. Captain Sidey accompanied him. The
task was a difficult and dangerous one, for, although the first twelve miles
were clear of the enemy and comparatively open, the last eight miles
of the journey led down the valley
of Six Mile Spruit, with high
hills to the right and lower ones to
the left, the enemy’s laager being
situated about half-way down on
the right. The Boers had thus the
option of stopping the patrol on the
way down, or cutting it off on the
return journey. The reconnoitring
party could reach the Crocodile
River in comparative safety by
advancing along the higher ground
to the left of the valley and holding
the commanding posts as far as
numbers permitted. But as this
course failed to draw out the Boers,
it was useless as a method of discovering
their strength and whereabouts.
Captain Clifford therefore
effected a compromise, reached the
river as above described, and when
about half-way through the valley on the return journey turned off in the
direction of the Boer laager, leaving Sergeant Mitchell and four men in
observation on high ground to cover his advance. As soon as he and his
party were well down to the Spruit, the Boers rushed out in large
numbers, forcing them to retreat in haste towards the covering party, who
were unable to fire, as they could not distinguish friend from foe. The
whole patrol, being outnumbered by ten to one, with their line of retreat
threatened, had no choice but to escape as best they could in an easterly
direction. Three men were taken prisoners through their horses being
exhausted. Sergeant Mitchell’s party, finding itself cut off, escaped in a
southerly direction, and reached Johannesburg in safety next day. The
patrol that night came back nine short. It turned out that three had
been taken prisoners, and the remaining six arrived in camp from various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>directions the following day. The three prisoners returned three days
later, having been treated with great kindness by the Boers, who only took
their horses, rifles, and accoutrements, and were evidently much amused by
the way in which our patrols were sent out every day to face almost certain
capture or death in accordance with orders. They considered this patrol
as very useful to supply them with the necessaries of warfare, and treated the
whole thing as a huge joke. During
the retreat on the first of these
two patrols Private Graham did very
good work. When Cayley’s horse
had fallen and then run away,
Graham made him hold his stirrup
to expedite his flight on foot, and
offered to take turn and turn about
riding and running with him. It
became evident that they could not
both get away, so Graham, taking
Cayley’s rifle and catching his horse
afterwards, brought both animals
and rifles out of action, saving them
from the hands of the enemy and
earning the commendation of the
Colonel on his arrival in camp.
On the 22nd Colonel Ross’s Irene
command was ordered to start at
two hours’ notice for Pretoria viâ
Swartzkop. He complied, camping
at Swartzkop for the night, and
reaching the camp by the Pretoria Racecourse next day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Captain Clifford, in an official report of the incident to
Colonel Lumsden, does full justice to Trooper Graham’s conduct
in the following words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>When about two miles from Crocodile River, while I was questioning
a farmer, the enemy suddenly opened fire on us from a ridge in front,
between 300 and 400 yards distant. I was with the scouts when this
happened. We galloped back to the rest of the patrol, which only consisted
of a total of nine troopers, and before we could take up any position
the fire began to come from three sides, so I gave the order to retire as
fast as possible to avoid being surrounded. In the retreat, under a heavy
fire, Trooper Cayley, one of the scouts, was thrown from his horse, whereupon
Trooper Graham, with great gallantry, stayed behind and gave
Cayley a ride on his own horse, running by his side, and then mounting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and Cayley running. The rest of the patrol being scattered, and the
ground much broken, these two were not missed for some time. After
some distance had been traversed, the Boers were getting so close, and the
fire so hot, that it would have been impossible for both to escape. Trooper
Cayley thereupon flung himself into a small ditch and Trooper Graham
made off, not, however, without bringing Cayley’s rifle. On the way to
rejoin the patrol, and still under fire, he came across a riderless horse of
another of the party, and brought it safely back with Cayley’s rifle. The
patrol then, observing him coming, turned to his support, and the Boers
discontinued the pursuit.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>For his gallant behaviour on this occasion Trooper Graham
was recommended by Colonel Lumsden for the Victoria Cross;
but instead of that coveted decoration he subsequently received
the Distinguished Conduct Medal.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: C.G. Brown</em></span><br />BERNARD CAYLEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The talented correspondent of the ‘Englishman’ writes as
follows of the same affair:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>One morning a patrol set forth to spy the land, an officer and eleven
men. They rode west for fifteen miles and entered the hills aforesaid,
their object being to reach the junction
of Six Mile Spruit with the
Crocodile River. The way being
purely cross-country it was a difficult
matter to locate their destination,
and seeing a farmhouse at the
top of a valley the patrol made for
it with the object of being directed.
The valley traversed was some
thousand yards wide from ridge to
ridge. At the far end was the farmhouse,
and beyond a low hill. Down
the middle of the valley ran a spruit
between high banks, forming a
donga deep and wide enough to cover
mounted men. The path running
up the valley crossed the donga
600 yards from the farmhouse. Our
fellows trotted up to the farmhouse,
some tackling the lady of the house,
and the others the Boer himself,
who was spotted on the road a little
way off. The good lady was a bit nervous, and rather hastily volunteered the
information that the Boers had all gone away. Though never dreaming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of their presence so near, this aroused the suspicions of the man to whom
the remark was made, and he went up to the farmer, and roughly
demanded where the Boers were. The question rather startled him, and
from his manner it became evident that Boers were about, though he
swore they had left the night before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thereupon the patrol, in open order, advanced across the rising to the
right, with Bearne, Graham, and Cayley in front. A wire fence obstructed
the way, and it was a moot point whether to go round by a gate to the
left or to use the wire-cutters. This fence was eighty yards from the top
of the ridge, to which it ran parallel. The cutting of the fence saved the
lives of the men mentioned. Hardly were they through the opening than
a heavy fire was opened on them at a range of fifty yards. The rest of
the party being a hundred yards behind, not yet up to the fence, Cayley,
Bearne, and Graham whipped round, and made for the cutting, which was
luckily immediately behind them. If they had gone round by the gate to
the left they would have had to stand fire getting to the gate, and then
run the gauntlet all the way back. As it was they got safely through the
cutting and legged it after the rest, the party making straight down
the valley for the donga already described. As the distance between the
Boers and the donga was only 800 yards, it can be imagined how hot the
fire was. Extraordinary to relate, not a man was touched during the brief
but dangerous interval which elapsed between leaving the wire fence and
reaching the donga. Arrived there a new foe sprang upon the unlucky
patrol.</p>

<div id='i280'  class='figleft id022'>
<img src='images/i_b_280.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>L.C. BEARNE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From the left of the hill behind the farmhouse, and at the point
where the left ridge forming the valley joined this hill, another lot of
Boers opened a heavy enfilade fire at a thousand
yards’ range. Their sanctuary was a sanctuary no
longer, and again the patrol fled, this time straight
for the opening in the hills by which they had
entered. Meantime the second lot of Boers kept up
a brisk fusillade, many of them mounting horses and
galloping along the ridge parallel with the flying
patrol. As our men had travelled some twenty
miles, their horses were pretty beaten, so that the
Boers, in light order, had no difficulty in catching
up and taking pot shots at short range. Shortly
after leaving the donga, Cayley’s horse fell heavily,
and got away from his fallen rider. Thereupon
Graham pulled up, gave Cayley his stirrup, and the latter ran until
exhausted. Graham then very gallantly insisted upon Cayley riding
while Graham ran. When beaten, Graham mounted again and Cayley ran.
At this point the Boers had got close up and were pouring in a hot fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and, the situation endangering both men, Cayley, who was much
exhausted, let go, insisting on Graham leaving him, hoping himself to
escape the Boers by hiding among the rocks. Near the same place
Bearne’s horse stopped, dead beat. Bearne got off and ran until done,
when he, too, took cover from the Boers, who were close at his heels
peppering for all they were worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the remainder of the patrol, headed by Captain Clifford, who
was in charge, had got well away, and they eventually returned to camp
late at night, having had to walk most of the way back, as their horses
were too done to carry them. But Cayley and Bearne never had a chance,
for the Boers had never lost sight of them. They were quickly routed
out of their cover, and having dropped their arms when running, defenceless,
they had to surrender to overwhelming numbers. The Boers
explained to them what had happened on their side, and it would seem to
be only by a bit of luck that the whole patrol was not captured. Right
behind the low hill at the back of the farmhouse was a laager, where a
number of Boers were encamped. Five, <em>they</em> said, though there must
have been quadruple the number, Boers had gone over to the farmhouse
already mentioned half an hour before the patrol appeared. Failing to
find forage there, they had proceeded up the hill with the intention of
crossing into the next valley to visit another farmhouse. When on the
sky line they spotted our patrol advancing. The Boers immediately lay
low to watch what happened. Realising that the patrol was riding into
the lion’s mouth, they meant to keep doggo until the party was close up,
and consequently far away from the only point of escape—viz., the road by
which it had come. When close up they would open fire, warning at
the same time their own camp over the hill scarce a mile away. Luckily
for us, their camp proved slow to hear, else the main body of Boers would
have rushed for the donga and regularly trapped the crowd. As it was
our men had reached the donga before the laager had awakened to the
situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cayley and Bearne were kindly treated but marched about unmercifully,
eventually reaching the main Boer laager at Commando Nek, where a
short time previously the Lincolns and Scots Greys had come to such
terrible grief. There the unhappy pair were released to struggle twenty
miles into Pretoria as best they might.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after the adventurous descent on the Crocodile River fastnesses,
which I have already described, a second and larger patrol, with
Captain Clifford again in command, set forth to avenge the disasters of
the first. As I have a particular regard for my personal safety, and
believing the neighbourhood accursed, I found it convenient to be otherwise
occupied at the moment when patrol No. 2 started. And subsequent
events proved me wiser than my generation. Not being present at what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>happened, I cannot, of course, tell exactly how it came about. Nor could
I piece the twenty different accounts given me into a satisfactory whole,
for the very good reason that no two of the stories afterwards told me
would fit in. However, it would appear that it happened somewhat
thus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party started out at daybreak, and reached the scene of the
previous disaster in good time in the morning. Needless to say, the Boers
were on the look-out this time, and so soon as the patrol hove in sight
made their dispositions. With a wariness born of experience there was
no venturing into the valley. The party spread over the ridge along
which the Boers had followed them on the first occasion, and advanced
in skirmishing order with scouts in front smelling out every nook and
cranny. And so they came, as they say in racing parlance, right along
the ridge until close up to the farmhouse. All the time the Boers in
force were happily contemplating these operations from the opposite ridge,
which they had selected as being the one not likely to be scouted. As
the ridge ran into the hill behind the farmhouse it became necessary, if any
act of retribution was to be performed on the farmer, to diverge from that
line of advance and make for the farmhouse. This was done, and of course
brought the patrol into closer order. At the farmhouse one of its occupants
handed a note to Captain Clifford. It was from the farmer, and ran, ‘Am
going down the road to kill a pig for a neighbour. Will be back in a few
minutes.’ And then the band began to play. From the hill in front and
the ridge on the right the Mausers spoke out their unwelcome messages
in a continuous stream, till it seemed as if the blue sky above must crack
for the noise. Round whipped the patrol and in went the spurs, Captain
Clifford leading his men down the valley that seemed as if it must spell
death for the whole party. There were 200 Boers in all firing at an
average range of 800 yards for a distance of two miles. Several horses
were shot, several fell, some stopped from exhaustion; but there was no
way of getting out except along the road which ran parallel to the ridge
occupied by the enemy. The rocky going on the other ridge precluded a
retreat over its inhospitable sides, besides which it was commanded on
both slopes from the hill behind the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night at Irene the return of the patrol was anxiously awaited.
It seemed a strange thing, to many marvellous, that no man had a
mark on him, and this shows again what extraordinarily bad shooting
the Boers are capable of at moving bodies, and particularly when they are
not certain if another and concealed movement is not being conducted on
their rear. Of the party sent on the expedition one by one continued to
arrive back, some late the same night, some during the next day, some
even the day after, until at last the lot were accounted for. Three of the
unlucky patrol had trekked for Johannesburg, and advised us by telegraph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of their safety. Another struck the railway at Kaalfontein. And so
they straggled in, weary, hungry, and dirty. Several were taken prisoners,
but treated kindly enough, one attention in particular being much
appreciated. That was a stomach warmer of peach brandy before they
were set free for their march back to Irene. Rather an insulting message
given the released ones was to the effect that the Boers would have
coffee ready next time we came.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>After these events Colonel Lumsden’s request for more
active employment than his corps could find on lines of communication
was granted, and the sequel is described by a correspondent
of the ‘Madras Mail’:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We left Springs on July 16th, expecting to join General Hutton, who,
we heard, had had a severe engagement with heavy casualties, and was in
want of more mounted troops. However, after a night at Kaalfontein we
moved on to Irene, which place is the headquarters of the 8th Mounted
Infantry, now on communications between Johannesburg and Pretoria.
We remained at Irene a week, during which time we had some half-dozen
men taken prisoners owing to their horses giving out when being
pursued by the Boers, who were always lying in wait for our patrols.
We were exceedingly fortunate in having nobody hit on these occasions.
The prisoners were in every case released, their rifles and horses, of
course, being taken from them. Apparently the Boers now find prisoners
an encumbrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 22nd we moved to Pretoria, camping three miles outside the
town. Pretoria is prettily situated in a hollow surrounded by hills.
These hills to the south-west, and about ten miles out, sheltered a
number of Boers, and on the 27th we set out on a reconnaissance to find
out something about them. The force, under Brigadier-General Hickman,
consisted of the 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 8th Mounted Infantry Regiments, a
battery of Field Artillery, and a battalion of Infantry (the Cornwalls).
We saw nothing of the enemy until evening, when the advance guard
came into touch and exchanged shots with the enemy’s scouts, who retired.
The next morning we had scarcely started when we heard the now familiar
double thud of the Mauser, and found that the Oxford Company of the
8th Mounted Infantry were engaged. It was a very different country from
what we had been used to, and it did not suit us nearly so well. We
were in a valley with steep hills on either side, the slopes of which were
covered with loose stones and rocks of every size and shape, which made
the going almost impossible for horses and very trying for the men.
The pom-poms came into action close on our left and shelled a steep
kopje opposite for some time; meanwhile, a brisk rifle fire was being kept
up by the Mounted Infantry on our left. At the end of about an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the General had apparently found out all he wanted to know, for the
order to retire came, the 8th Mounted Infantry to act as rearguard.
Lumsden’s were deputed to guard the left flank, which we did, retiring
by alternate companies along the top of the range of kopjes, while the
Infantry and guns moved along the valley. The enemy followed in a
half-hearted way, but were easily kept in check by the pom-poms, which
dropped shells into them whenever they showed themselves in any
numbers. Beyond firing at a few of their scouts, we (<em>i.e.</em>, Lumsden’s)
saw nothing of them. The casualties had been slight, the Oxford
Company 8th Mounted Infantry having one man killed and one wounded.
An officer’s charger hit was all the damage done to Lumsden’s Horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 27th General Ian Hamilton’s division, consisting of General
Bruce Hamilton’s, General Mahon’s, and General Hickman’s brigades,
marched into Pretoria. Lord Roberts and his Staff, with General Ian
Hamilton on his right and Lord Kitchener on his left, took up his
position in the market square while the troops marched past, cheering
him as they went. The same day we heard the good news that 5,000 of
the enemy had surrendered to General Hunter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>More active service, however, meant for Lumsden’s Horse a
transfer to some other column, and the time had thus come when
they were to bid farewell to Colonel Ross, under whom they had
served for four months, and from their comrades of the
8th Mounted Infantry, with whom they had marched and fought
in many actions. Colonel Lumsden expressed the feeling of all
ranks in his parting words to Colonel Ross, which were full of
appreciation for the many kindnesses shown by that gallant
commander towards Lumsden’s Horse. What Colonel Ross
thought of the corps and its officers may be gathered from the
regimental order acknowledging their services, and from a letter
in which Colonel Ross writes as follows:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse joined the 8th Corps M.I. about the middle of April
1900, and served with the corps till the end of July, when they were
transferred to General Mahon’s command. This was probably the most
completely equipped ‘unit’ that joined the forces in South Africa during
the war—a well-organised regimental transport, of Indian pattern, a
complete regimental hospital and veterinary establishment, and every
‘necessary’ of life for man and beast for a campaign in almost any
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>personnel</em></span> of the corps was in keeping with everything else.
Colonel Lumsden, though not an experienced campaigner when he first
arrived on active service, was a capable organiser, and had the natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>gift of commanding the respect and cheerful obedience of all who served
under him, and he soon qualified as a competent leader under fire. He was
ably supported by a well-selected body of officers and non-commissioned
officers; and there was an evident determination among all ranks that the
representatives of the Indian Auxiliary Forces should justify their selection
by the Indian public. The ‘rank-and-file’ was composed of gentlemen
who had been used to the comparative luxury of an Indian planter’s life,
and who were untrained in cooking for themselves and attending to their
horses. But they soon adapted themselves to the situation, and cheerfully
took their share of all the work of Regular soldiers, and with such
success that an experienced officer like General Hutton expressed his
admiration of the manner in which they did it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ‘fighting’ capacity of Lumsden’s Horse cannot be entirely
estimated from the gaps in their ranks. They were, as a result of their
training in civil life, more ‘self-reliant’ than the rank-and-file of our
Regular Army, and the looser formations they were consequently able to
adopt account in a great measure for their comparatively small losses.
The opinion formed of the corps by the Commander-in-Chief can be
gathered from the great number of distinctions, promotions, and commissions
in the Regular Army which were conferred on those who
remained. The time-honoured maxim, ‘Blood will tell,’ was never better
exemplified than in this corps, and, should it be my lot ever again to
command troops in the field, I ask for no better fortune than to have a
similar body to Lumsden’s Horse.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>To have served under two leaders of high reputation for ability
in handling Irregular troops was a stroke of good fortune that
did not fall to the lot of many Volunteer Corps in South Africa.
Lumsden’s Horse had every reason to be thankful that the lot
was theirs, and they appreciated it fully. In exchanging from
the 8th Mounted Infantry Regiment to another column, of which
Colonel Bryan Mahon was Brigadier, they did not forget the
commander under whom they had served so long; but affection
for him was happily consistent with out-and-out admiration for
the officer to whose force they were transferred after leaving Irene.
Both were thorough soldiers, having strong sympathies with
Volunteers and a complete understanding of the peculiarities that
distinguish them from Regulars. In other words, both were
born leaders of men. Colonel Mahon, or General as he then
was by local rank, had proved himself to be a commander of
great dash and resourcefulness in his conduct of operations by
which he won not only the affectionate confidence of his own
troops, but also the respect of enemies who still speak with
admiration of the young Cavalry officer who beat them at their
own game by rapid flank movements on the way to Mafeking,
and effected the relief of that beleaguered garrison in spite of all
De la Rey could do to prevent him. In ten days he marched a
distance of 230 miles through country destitute of supplies, where
no other forces had disputed possession with the Boers since war
began. He outwitted the cleverest of De la Rey’s lieutenants
at Kraaipan by a night march which won his adversary’s admiration,
and he took a great convoy of Cape carts and heavier
transport full of provisions into Mafeking without having lost a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>single waggon. Describing that surprise at Kraaipan, when,
after waiting in expectation of an attack by which Mahon should
fall into the trap laid for him, the Boers suddenly realised that
the British column had disappeared, one of their scouts said,
‘We did not get much rest, as somebody had to be on the look-out
all night. Your laager was quite near to us, but we did not
see or hear anything move. In the morning, however, the
whole had vanished, and when it was too late to stop them we
heard they were trekking away north-west towards a desert
where nobody but Boers or natives would expect to find water.
Your General must have had somebody with him who knew that
country well or he would never have ventured there.’ The
‘somebody’ in this case may have been Colonel Frank Rhodes,
the bearer of a name which is one to conjure with still among
the native tribes of Bechuanaland. He was Mahon’s Intelligence
officer, and information gleaned by him made the night
march possible; but it was the young Brigadier who planned and
carried it into execution at a time when his enemies thought
they had him surely trapped. When a complete history of the
campaign comes to be written, that march of Mahon’s for the
relief of Mafeking will rank high among the most daring and
successful operations. All this story was known weeks before
the General himself arrived at Pretoria with the Imperial Light
Horse, who had won fresh honours in that enterprise under a
leader whose praises they never tired of singing. No expectation
of being brigaded with such a famous corps under such
a brigadier had occurred to Lumsden’s Horse when they left
Irene. Indeed, they seem to have regarded themselves as an
integral unit of the 8th Mounted Infantry up to the day when
Colonel Ross, receiving orders for a movement southwards, went
off with other corps of his command, leaving Lumsden’s Horse
behind. Meanwhile, however, they had been placed for a time
at the disposal of Colonel Hickman, under whom they took
part in the brief operations already described towards Crocodile
River, which were merely a reconnaissance for the more
important enterprise to follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that Lord Roberts, about this time,
had both hands fully occupied in keeping Botha at arm’s length
in the east and stretching out his left with considerable force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>westward to ward off attacks by De la Rey and others who were
causing General Baden-Powell much anxiety for the safety of
Rustenburg, which he held with a very small number of troops.
It would never have done to let the newly emancipated hero of
Mafeking be subjected to another siege. Therefore, when he
reported that a strong force was again threatening Rustenburg
Lord Roberts determined to withdraw that garrison to Commando
Nek, while the small force holding Lichtenburg was to retire
upon Zeerust. Accordingly, General Ian Hamilton received
orders to march to Rustenburg and bring Baden-Powell’s force
back with him. At the same time Sir Frederick Carrington was
directed to advance from Mafeking with his mounted troops to
the assistance of Colonel Hore, who, with 140 Bushmen, 80 men
of the Rhodesian Regiment, and 80 Rhodesian Volunteers, was
at Eland’s River with a convoy of supplies for the Rustenburg
garrison, and held up there by an intercepting body of Boers.
This brief summary of the general situation is necessary to a
clear understanding of the exigencies that necessitated General
Ian Hamilton’s movement eastward along the Magaliesberg, and
the reconnaissance immediately preceding it, in all of which
important operations Lumsden’s Horse were actively engaged
from start to finish. The force marched in three columns,
Colonel Hickman’s being on the left, General Ian Hamilton’s
in the centre, and <a id='corr288.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Brigader'>Brigadier</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_288.24'><ins class='correction' title='Brigader'>Brigadier</ins></a></span>-General Mahon’s on the right, each
being separated from the other by a rough range of hills which
in places became quite mountainous.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this range, sweeping round the hollow in which Pretoria
lies, and then stretching away westward by irregular curves past
Rustenburg to Eland’s River, is known as the Magaliesberg, and
famed for the fertility of valleys that broaden out at its feet from
many rugged kloofs. In peace-time it is the great tobacco-producing
district of the Transvaal—a veritable garden, where
orange groves, flourishing in wild luxuriance, sweeten the air
with their fragrance, and brighten the landscape with the richness
of their golden fruit. In war-time its commanding crests
and narrow defiles formed a series of strongholds for the commandos
that rallied round General De la Rey and by their daring
raids gained a reputation as the best fighters of all Boers then in
the field. Every Kaffir path by which scouts could move unseen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>was familiar to them. They knew every point from which wide
views could be obtained in all directions, and every nook in
which men might hide secure from observation, ready for a
sudden attack if occasion should serve, yet having more than
one way open for escape from any danger that might threaten
them. General Baden-Powell with the relieved garrison from
Mafeking had marched through a mountainous country and
crossed the Magaliesberg to Rustenburg, meeting no opposition.
The Boer forces belonging to that district had then more serious
affairs to occupy them elsewhere. But after the fight at Diamond
Hill, when General Botha retired to the Eastern Transvaal,
De la Rey came back to his old haunts on the Magaliesberg,
surprised a British post near Zilikat’s Nek, and began a series of
operations by which he threatened to cut off all supplies from
Rustenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden continues his diary:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Two days after our return to Pretoria from the reconnaissance under
Colonel Hickman the 8th Mounted Infantry received orders to entrain
at 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> for Wolve Hoek, the station next south of Vereeniging; but at
the station the order as far as we were concerned was countermanded,
and we were told to return and report to General Mahon. His
instructions were that we should remain in our present camp and fall in
as rearguard when his column marched off for Rustenburg on August 1.
The morning of that day, therefore, found us in rear of the baggage
of his column, which was moving to Rustenburg, north of the Magaliesberg
Range, to the relief of Baden-Powell, while General Hamilton
proceeded up the valley south of the Magaliesberg. Mahon’s brigade was
unique in its composition, consisting almost entirely of Volunteer
Mounted Infantry—viz., Imperial Light Horse, Lumsden’s Horse, New
Zealand Mounted Infantry, Queensland Mounted Infantry, a regiment
of Yeomanry, two squadrons 18th Hussars (the squadrons that were
captured after the battle of Talana), and the M Battery R.H.A.—in all
about 1,500 strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Firing began two miles out of Pretoria, and pom-poms and guns
played merrily all day, clearing the range which divided the two columns.
We camped twelve miles out. The plan for next day subsequently
transpired to have been that General Hamilton should make a frontal
attack and drive the enemy off the high ground, where they had taken up
a position, near Zilikat’s Nek, while our brigade, making a wide movement,
to the right, was to cut off the retiring foe from the Schwartz and Roode
Kopjes, to which they were expected to retreat. Apparently something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>went wrong with the arrangements, for Hamilton, attacking before we
got into position, lost some twenty men and the Boers escaped.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The point at which General Hamilton made his attack was
from the south side of the Magaliesberg range near Uitval
Nek, which the enemy held strongly. As General Mahon’s
brigade was moving along the north side of those precipitous
ridges through a country thick with scrub, no communication
could be kept up between the two forces, and Hamilton, whose
march was unimpeded by natural difficulties, had not allowed sufficient
time for his colleague to cover the treacherous ground
through which many tributaries of the Crocodile River run their
devious courses. On getting touch with the enemy, whose position
he had located, Ian Hamilton went for them at once, a portion of
Cunningham’s brigade making as if for a frontal attack, while
two companies of the Berkshire Regiment, led by Major Elmhirst
Rhodes, gallantly escaladed the steep cliff overlooking the pass
from its eastern side. Hamilton’s losses in this fight amounted
to forty killed and wounded before the Boers could be dislodged;
but as soon as they found that their position was under fire from
above, where the Berkshires had gained a footing, the enemy fled,
abandoning their waggons and horses. Unfortunately, delayed
by the obstacles already mentioned, Mahon’s mounted troops did
not come up in time to take any part, otherwise but few of the
enemy could have escaped. A correspondent of the ‘Times of
India,’ taking up the story a day after this fight, when General
Mahon’s force had got through the denser bush country into a
more smiling region only to find that the enemy had disappeared,
writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The valley we were passing through was well watered and cultivated,
and in some places fairly thickly wooded; much pleasanter country for
travelling through than the bare monotonous veldt of which we had seen so
much in the Free State. We passed many snug farmhouses, also several
flourishing orange groves. At one place there were acres of orange trees
simply laden with fruit, and as they were going to waste we were allowed
to help ourselves. The oranges were very fine and beautifully ripe; one
man from each sub-section was allowed to go and gather them, and in a
few minutes came back literally bulging with them—haversacks, nosebags,
pockets, &amp;c., overflowing, the little tangerines being especially
appreciated. Some of the Australians were so enchanted by this valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that they doubted whether there could be another such in all the world.
That night we were all aroused to assist in putting out a veldt fire, which
had approached uncomfortably close to the camp; owing to a high wind
and the fact that the grass was particularly long and dry, it was much
fiercer than is usually the case. However, we set to work with blankets
and beat it out where it was too threatening, and then burnt a ring round
the camp, effectually stopping its progress. A Boer spy was caught in
camp that night. He had a pass on him showing that he had taken the
oath of neutrality, and he had expansive bullets in his bandolier. He was
shot next morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Progress was naturally very slow, owing to the difficult nature of the
country and the fact that the hills had to be very carefully scouted. We
were rearguard that day and saw no fighting ourselves, but the scouts in
front evidently soon put up the Boers, as we heard rifle shots being
exchanged constantly, and every now and then our guns shelled the
retreating enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I may mention here that the Imperial Light Horse formed part of
the Mounted Infantry in General Mahon’s brigade. This was the first
time we had come across this famous corps, which had done such splendid
work during the war, and a very fine body of men we thought them.
Possessing a knowledge of the language and in many cases of the country,
they are most useful as scouts, and General Mahon fully recognised that
fact during the whole march, as he gave them plenty of work to do.
Besides this, they were old friends of his, having been under his command
with the Mafeking Relief Column, and they have been with him ever
since. Ian Hamilton, we heard afterwards, had met with a pretty
stubborn resistance from the Boers in his valley, where, as had been
anticipated, their main body was opposed to him, and he had several
casualties. We only advanced about twelve miles that day. Next day
the driving process recommenced, Lumsden’s Horse during the greater
part of the time occupying a very high kopje, from which we were ordered
to keep a bright look-out and to hold it if attacked. It was a devil of a
climb (the horses were kept below), but the view from the top almost
compensated us for our trouble. This part of the country was certainly
the best we had been through so far; beautifully wooded in many places,
and dotted all over with farms and orange groves. The oranges were
simply delicious, especially the tangerine variety, and we took full
advantage of the opportunity afforded us of having our fill of them, each
man eating as many as he could on the spot, and carrying away a nosebagful
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently the Generals had orders to adopt strong measures in cases
of farms harbouring Boers, or from which any sniping might be done,
or in which ammunition might be stored, as it was a daily occurrence for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>two or three of them to be fired and rased to the ground. Looking into
the next valley from our high perch we saw a huge camp below which
we at first took to be a Boer laager, but we found out afterwards it was
Ian Hamilton’s force, which had advanced quicker than we had, and
had encamped for the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had got to Commando Nek that night, and heard that the Boers
from the centre valley had already slipped through. This was unfortunate,
but could not be helped, as we could not push on farther than we did
without risking the sacrifice of many valuable lives. I think we were
informed that the enemy numbered about 600, and that their main body
had got away some time before, leaving behind a few snipers to keep us
in check. This is their usual method of proceeding, and a very sound
one it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>One has to see the country oneself to realise what an easy thing
it is for a few men well placed to keep a large body back. We send
out our scouts, and immediately they are fired on. We shell the places
from which they have been shot at. After this has gone on for some
little time we advance again, and so on. Progress is very slow, and
meantime the bird has flown. As I say, one has to be out in the
country to understand properly what difficulties the attacking party has
to contend against. With the numberless examples before them of our
men blundering into traps and being slaughtered and having to surrender
through going at things baldheaded, as they say, our Generals have
learned caution. Then, on the other hand, the slow progress enables
the enemy to get away. ‘What can do?’ ‘Horns of dilemma!’ as our
Babu friends would say.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, again, the Boers know the country thoroughly, and when hard
pressed the Commandant simply tells his men to scatter and appoints
some meeting place further on. His convoy scatters likewise, and all,
travelling by three or four different routes, arrive at the rendezvous in due
course. We, on the other hand, have to follow the beaten path, and
are always being hung up for hours by our convoys getting stuck in
drifts, &amp;c. It is not to be wondered at that the Boers, possessing these
advantages, so often elude us.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Ian Hamilton’s column came through the Nek next day,
and, joining hands with General Mahon, proceeded towards Rustenburg,
in which direction the Boers had fled, and where Baden-Powell was said
to be surrounded and unable to get away. Horses and men fared very
well just then, the former getting plenty of oat-hay commandeered from
the hostile farms we passed, and green barley and oat-grass in the fields at
the midday halts; and the latter securing fowls, geese, sucking-pigs, &amp;c.,
which were very plentiful in Kaffir kraals and farmhouses. During the
two days it took us to reach Rustenburg we expected to get in touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>with the enemy at any moment, but they did not come up to the scratch,
and we entered the town unopposed on August 5.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that, hearing of Ian Hamilton’s approach, the Boers
abandoned the kopjes surrounding Rustenburg and relieved the pressure
on Baden-Powell, who, having heard in the meantime that General
Carrington, working with a small force in the country between Rustenburg
and Mafeking, was in danger of losing his convoy, had moved out
to his assistance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The actual position was that Colonel Hore, marching with
a convoy of supplies from Zeerust to Rustenburg, and, finding
his way barred by a greater force than he could hope to cope
with, and his retreat also cut off, had entrenched himself at
Eland’s River. There he waited for the relieving force under
General Carrington, which never came nearer than within sound
of the Boer guns, and unfortunately the Rustenburg column
also stopped short in its attempt to relieve Colonel Hore, who
had to fight it out for a week or so longer against enormous
odds that might have overwhelmed his force but for the magnificent
determination displayed by Australian Bushmen and
Rhodesian Volunteers. The failure of that attempt at relief is
briefly described by Colonel Lumsden, whose diary also summarises
subsequent operations in pursuit of De Wet in the
following passages:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Next day we expected a well-earned rest, but Mahon’s brigade was
lent to strengthen General Baden-Powell’s force, which was to move at
daybreak next morning to assist Colonel Hore, who was known to be in
difficulties in the direction of or beyond Eland’s River (one of the many
streams bearing that name in the colony). This entailed a sharp ride of
fifteen miles, which brought us to Eland’s River and within hearing of
the cannonading, but no further. On the bank of the river was a small
group of officers, prominent among them being General Baden-Powell,
and by his side were Colonel Plumer and Major Baden-Powell. We
found the great man seated on a rock, surrounded by his Staff, and sketching
hard with both hands! Most of us had not seen him before, so it
can be imagined how glad we were to have the opportunity of getting
a good look at England’s popular hero at the moment. We were also
delighted at the idea of being under his command, if only for a short
time. We had a better view of him on the way back, and he appeared
to be very fit and none the worse for his Mafeking experiences.</p>

<p class='c000'>While waiting here to rest and water the horses we heard big guns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>firing in the direction in which Carrington’s force was situated, and
expected momentarily to be ordered to advance; but after some time we
were told that Baden-Powell had tapped the telegraph wire and learned
from Carrington that he had repulsed the Boers and had got his convoy
away safely, and that he did not require our assistance. I am afraid,
however, that the wrong source must have been tapped, and that a
false message, intended to deceive, must then have come, not from
Carrington, but from the wily Boers. After two hours’ rest we returned
to Rustenburg for the night, having apparently accomplished nothing
in particular, except a march of thirty miles all told. Rustenburg
was then evacuated, and the whole of General Hamilton’s division
concentrated near Commando Nek, resting there one day. We then
went to join the De Wet hunt with Mahon’s brigade in front, and
in spite of only a little skirmishing advanced somewhat slowly. On the
15th we came into touch with the eight Generals who were pursuing De
Wet on an organised plan from the south towards Oliphant’s Nek. We
were supposed to have been in time to cut off De Wet and prevent him
going north to Oliphant’s Nek, but were unfortunately too late, and
all we could do was to join the others and follow him up. The next
evening we were in touch with the rearguard and in sight of the Nek.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following morning we escorted the big guns to within range of
the Nek, took our position on the hills on the right, and watched the
Infantry make the attack. It was a very pretty sight from our position,
but the resistance was slight, so, going through the Nek, we reached
Rustenburg for the third time and spent the night there, our laager being
well supplied by way of a change with turkeys and fowls poached from
local preserves. Away again next morning Pretoria-wards, reaching Sterkstroom
at 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the next day. Hardly had we off-saddled, with visions
of a raid on a field of sweet potatoes in view, before we received orders to
again saddle up and march at 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> after De Wet, who was reported just
in front of us. From 5 till 11 our weary horses struggled on through the
darkness. We bivouacked for the night within three miles of Commando
Nek, hoping, as we had often hoped before, to get De Wet next morning.
Long ere day broke we were up and away again, only to find that De
Wet’s force had gone north along the river towards Roode Kopjes,
which we reached at daybreak with still no signs of the enemy. On the
right bank of the river and a mile off were some low rocky kopjes covered
with scrub, on the left a series of high but broken hills. We, as advance
guard, took up our position on the latter as the Boer convoy was
trekking away in full view across the open from the shelter of the former,
and just out of range of the twelve pom-poms. The temptation was great
to push on in pursuit, but our General was luckily wiser and preferred to
reconnoitre across the river before implicating the guns and main body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>in what turned out to be a most difficult drift. We from our position
looked on while the New Zealanders on the right crossed the drift and,
spreading out, advanced to the broken ground. We had just made up our
mind that all was clear, and that the General had been culpably slow,
when a frightful fusillade burst out on the unfortunate reconnoitrers
from a range of fifty yards. There was nothing for it but to race back
as hard as they could, leaving six casualties behind, two of which resulted
fatally. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coup</em></span> having failed, and horse and man being incapable of
more, we all returned to the previous night’s camp. At 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the
20th we reoccupied the same kopjes, forced the passage of the river, and
with little further resistance got into the open country five miles beyond.
We then marched through bushveldt to Zoutpans, Warmbaths, and
Waterval, back to Pretoria, with very little to record in the ten days
so occupied, the only interesting feature being the peculiar country
known as bushveldt, best described as a sea of stunted thorn trees
(familiarly known as toothpick trees), with an undergrowth of coarse
grass, no roads, but tracks of heavy sand which delayed the Transport very
much. Scouting was practically impossible, as it was very difficult to get
horses through the formidable thorny scrub, while vision was limited to
thirty yards.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The operations are described in fuller detail by correspondents
of Indian papers, whose interesting records of events in which
they took part need to be dovetailed together for the sake of a
connected narrative. It is necessary, however, to say here by way
of introduction that after accomplishing its mission in the relief
of Rustenburg and the withdrawal of that garrison General Ian
Hamilton’s column became involved by force of circumstances
in a series of intricate operations with other columns moving
from east, west, and south with the object of catching the wily
De Wet between them. One correspondent thus describes the
march out of Rustenburg:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>It having been decided to abandon the town, the night was spent in
destroying a lot of Boer ammunition and rifles of every description which
had been stored in the gaol. There was a constant succession of reports
as the cartridges exploded, and it sounded exactly as if a smart general
engagement was taking place. The next day, the 7th, Rustenburg was
completely evacuated, and the four brigades marched back on their way
towards the Crocodile River. Those of the inhabitants who had claimed
British protection also moved out with our convoy, in addition to whom
were forty Boer prisoners, including Piet Kruger, Oom Paul’s son, under
escort. As our progress was considerably retarded by the large convoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>it was despatched at night on the 8th to a situation of safety. Each
brigade was then operating separately, though supporting each other, with
Mahon’s as a flying column. The next morning the Australians had a
brush with some sixty Boer snipers, but the main body made a dash for
Uitval Nek, only to find that the enemy had again anticipated our arrival
and had bolted. Getting through Commando Nek on August 9, we rejoined
Ian Hamilton, who was encamped on the other side. This was the
largest camp we had been in so far. There must have been quite 15,000
men there, including troops from many parts of the world. All General
Baden-Powell’s as well as General Mahon’s column were Irregulars,
so that with General Ian Hamilton’s Regulars we were perhaps as
representative a gathering as has ever camped together. Englishmen,
Highlanders, Welshmen, and Irishmen, Australians (of all sorts), Canadians,
New Zealanders, Tasmanians, Imperial Yeomanry, ‘Lumsden’s’ from India,
and Colonials from all parts of South Africa, the Imperial Light Horse,
the Rhodesian Regiment, some of Montmorency’s Scouts, &amp;c., were
present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New Zealanders gave a sing-song that night, the visitors sitting
or standing round a huge log fire and the performers occupying the
centre. It was an excellent show, several very good men taking the
boards, or rather the veldt. The <em>finale</em> was a march round by some of
the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders with pipes and drums playing.
Our entertainers, I must not forget to mention, supplied the crowd liberally
with rum, a much-appreciated drink among Tommies and Volunteers
alike. Mixed with sugar and water and taken hot it is hard to
beat, and has kept off many a fever, I am sure, in wet weather. I may
mention that rum was only rationed out very occasionally, except in
extremely bad weather, when we generally got it daily. Rum nights,
needless to say, were hailed with delight, and shouts of ‘Roll up for your
rum’ would be heard all round the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the sequence of events may be appropriately interrupted
for the sake of some amusing incidents and <a id='corr296.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ancedotes'>anecdotes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_296.32'><ins class='correction' title='ancedotes'>anecdotes</ins></a></span>
told by another correspondent, who, in connection with this
great gathering of troops in our camp near Commando Nek,
writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>After considerable practice the amateur cooks could make a savoury
repast out of very little. If there was a garden about we grubbed up
some vegetables, with which even the trek-ox served out in Government
rations made an excellent stew. It was our fortune this night, however,
to be better provided for by a lucky chance. While engaged in drawing
the meagre rations and arguing with the Quartermaster-Sergeant over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>details of ounces and pennyweights, that had come to be regarded by us as
very important matters, we suddenly espied a great scurry going on about
a mile away, crowds of men rushing after what we at last made out to be
a small deer. In and out it went among patrol tents, horses, saddles, carts,
and guns. Frantic efforts were made in vain to catch it; men left whatever
they were doing to join in the chase, rolling over in their endeavours
to be first. Everybody threw something, and many dangerous missiles
came hurtling through the air. But the deer ran on and suddenly
turned our way. We also missed it by yards, and the shouting crowd
swept by, losing sight of their quarry presently, and not knowing whither
it had gone. A man of ours happened to be lying rolled up in his
blanket asleep. The din roused him, and just as he was beginning to move
the buck rose for a leap over his body. He caught it in the outspread
blanket and kept it there. So the game came to our mess after all by
sheer luck. On the strength of it we invited our very good friends and
next-door neighbours, the Bushmen (Queensland Mounted Infantry) to
dine with us that night, and soon after sunset they came round to our
fire. Very good fellows they were, and a very genial dinner we had. Our
guests brought their own stew, which was excellent, and their coffee too,
with which to eke out our supplies. One of our men produced some good
cheroots afterwards, and we sat on into the night, smoking, sipping coffee,
and telling stories, the hills all around being lighted up with lines of
veldt fires and the sky illuminated by a glorious full moon. Some of the
Bushmen’s stories against themselves were most amusing. They had as
good a name as anybody for horse-stealing and cattle-lifting. One of
them told us gravely that when he was walking one day through another
regiment’s lines a sergeant spotted him and gave the order ‘Stand to
your horses.’ He said he was so overcome by the ‘compliment,’ that he
could hardly acknowledge it. On another occasion, at a midday halt,
when the ‘cow-gun’ teams were brought back from watering, the distracted
officer in charge found one of the fattest and best oxen was
missing. He only just discovered it in time to save its life and deprive the
Bushmen of a feast. They told us many tricks for changing a horse’s
marks, brands, colour, and general appearance, so that no man might know
his own horse thus transformed, and I looked anxiously towards my own
chestnut quite expecting to find that he had either been taken away to
the camp of our neighbours or ‘faked’ practically before my own eyes.
Others joined our circle as the moon rose higher. The whole camp seemed
in excellent spirits. Sounds of revelry, wafted on the still night air,
reached us from many a camp-fire; snatches of song, broken anon by
outbursts of cheering; elsewhere uprose the strains of the Highland
pipes. Rumour is busy that we are to join in the chase after De Wet,
who is breaking away north. We wonder as we roll into our blankets
when will be our next day of rest.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>And the rumours were true for once. Not many hours
elapsed before Mahon’s brigade, with the remainder of Hamilton’s
force, was on the move southward and westward through
Commando Nek into Rustenburg again, and then away north-east,
still pursuing into the bushveldt the elusive force which
they took to be De Wet’s. As a matter of fact, De Wet had
already left this force. He, personally, did not quit the Magaliesberg
range, but, doubling back with a small band of trusty
followers the day after his passage of Oliphant’s Nek, he slipped
through a neighbouring poort, and so got at once in rear of his
pursuers. They were thenceforth on the heels of a fresh force,
which De la Rey had detached to serve as a will-o’-the-wisp. All
these facts the Editor has learned from the lips of General
De la Rey himself recently. The next rest did not come for
several weary days, owing to circumstances that are described by
other correspondents in the following letters:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>After a day’s rest (General Baden-Powell being left behind with a
small force to guard Commando Nek) the division advanced again in a
south-westerly direction to try to cut off De Wet, who was being driven
north by Kitchener, Methuen, Smith-Dorrien, Hart, and Broadwood. We
encountered a small body of fifty Boers, but a few shells sent among
these soon dislodged them from the kopje on which they had taken up a
position, and we did not see them again.</p>

<p class='c000'>We got to a place called Hekpoort the next day, and here it was decided
to convert Mahon’s brigade into a flying column, which meant that we
were to travel without any Transport, each man being served out with three
days’ rations, which he carried with him. This column was to work
independently of the rest of the division and be ready to start in pursuit
of De Wet at a moment’s notice, should we get news of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Ian Hamilton to follow on slowly by another route, Mahon’s
brigade marched at daybreak on the 12th, we acting as advance scouts.
The country hereabouts is very hilly, and affords excellent cover for
the wily sniper, so scouting was not all ‘beer and skittles.’ Visions of
grouse moors at home were naturally strong upon some of us that day,
and one’s thoughts ran irresistibly to parallels between the driving of
grouse and our attempts to round up De Wet. One was constantly on the
qui vive, expecting to be shot at any moment, as the enemy were known
to be about. Nothing happened, however, and the next few days were
spent in loafing along, doing about ten miles or so, in momentary
expectation of getting in touch with De Wet. But this gentleman’s
movements were as erratic as usual, and it was evidently impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>get any reliable information as to his exact whereabouts. It was known
that he was being driven towards Oliphant’s Nek by Lord Methuen
and the others mentioned above, and it would appear that the proper
course to have pursued was to have held this pass, which was the only
possible avenue of escape left to De Wet, and wait for him there, instead
of wandering about more or less aimlessly, as we were doing. This could
very easily have been done, one imagines, with a small portion of the
large force at General Hamilton’s disposal, and why it was not tried is an
unsolved mystery to a great many of us up to the present. As far as an
outsider can see, a very serious blunder was committed here, and we
apparently lost a chance of bringing the war to a speedy conclusion. Had
De Wet been caught, Botha would probably have surrendered, and the
other commandants would have followed suit.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was, however, we moved along slowly, the monotony being
broken now and again by an exchange of shots between our scouts and
scattered parties of Boers on the adjacent hills. About midday on
August 13 Lumsden’s Horse were detached from the main body and
sent off to the flank to reconnoitre, and on our way met a party of the
Imperial Light Horse who had been sent out to burn a farm situated in
a hollow among some hills from which the Boers had been sniping. The
officer in charge of the Imperial Light Horse party requested Captain
Noblett, under whose command we were, to keep us on the top of the
hill to prevent surprise while he and his men went and destroyed the farm.
This was done, but for some reason or another the Imperial Light Horse
officer changed his mind and did not burn the farm. While on the hill
we were told by some Kaffirs that the enemy (about eighty in number) had
left a few moments before; seeing our scouts coming over the hill, they
had fled precipitately. We went down to the farm after the Imperial Light
Horse party had gone on, and had hardly left it to return to the main body
again when we saw a small party of Boers on the hill on our right, and
these were doubtless the men referred to by the Kaffirs we had spoken to.
Instead of going by the road we took a short cut across the veldt, as it was
rather late and we wanted to get back to the main body before nightfall.
It turned out afterwards that it was as well we did so, as on the way we
heard firing on our right, and on approaching to see what it was all about
saw that the road led through a deep hollow among some low hills in
which the Boers had taken up their position. Had we taken the road we
should have walked right into the trap which they had evidently laid for
us, and should have got slaughtered. The firing we heard was an
exchange of compliments between these Boers and some dozen <a id='corr301.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Australian'>Australians</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_301.39'><ins class='correction' title='Australian'>Australians</ins></a></span>
who had also been sent out on reconnaissance duty, and who had posted
themselves on a hill opposite. Finding that they did not want any
assistance, we pushed on and joined the brigade again at about 5 o’clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>camping shortly afterwards. It is interesting to note that the spot we
camped at was the one that heard the first shots fired during the Jameson
Raid. The Boer <em>sangars</em> still exist, and were occupied that night by
Lumsden’s ‘outlying picket.’ Having no Transport, we had to depend on
whatever we had in our saddle-bags, and were consequently on rather short
commons; and the horses, too, fared badly, poor beasts, having to subsist
mostly on what grass they could pick up on the veldt and on such oat-hay
and mealies as we could get out of the farmhouses we passed. The latter
were very few and far between in that part of the country. Next day we
continued our march in the same direction, and both flanking parties
engaged the enemy’s snipers on several occasions. The Imperial Light
Horse reported having killed one Boer and wounded four others. On the
15th we acted as advance guard, and had not proceeded far when we
found ourselves wound up with five brigades—viz., Lord Kitchener’s,
Lord Methuen’s, General Hart’s, Smith-Dorrien’s, and a column under
Colonel Pilcher—that had all been co-operating with us, bent on surrounding
De Wet. But the Boer leader of a lost cause proved as slippery as ever,
and had again escaped <em>viâ</em> Oliphant’s Nek towards Rustenburg. The
valley we had passed through was mainly occupied by English and
German farmers, who complained bitterly at the constant visits of English
and Boer troops, as sympathy of any kind with either cause got them into
hot water with the other side, and the Boers are past masters as looters.
The good people of Rustenburg were in a like predicament, hence its
evacuation. We heard at a store here that De Wet had passed through
the previous day with our men in close pursuit. Later we were informed
that he had got through Oliphant’s Nek, which he had found unoccupied,
and that now the place was strongly held by the Boers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening I understand the various Generals got into consultation,
and it was decided that General Ian Hamilton should advance with his
division to attack the Nek and continue the chase after De Wet, while
Lord Kitchener and the others were, I believe, to proceed to the west of
Rustenburg, where the Boers under De la Rey were again giving
trouble.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We joined General Ian Hamilton that evening, and next day the whole
force marched in the direction of Oliphant’s Nek and got within a few miles
of it by about 4 that afternoon. As it was so late, and the place was
said to be so strongly held, General Ian Hamilton decided on deferring his
attack till next day. Before we camped for the night the advance scouts
got into touch with the enemy, and we heard several exchanges of shots
going on in front. Shortly afterwards we were moved up in support, and
stayed till dark, after which we went back to camp, which had been
pitched about two miles off, leaving a strong mounted picket behind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Lumsden’s Horse alone supplied forty men. Writing about picket duty
reminds me that it was particularly trying during this march. Since
leaving Pretoria we had been supplying forty or fifty men nearly every
night—<em>i.e.</em>, about 50 per cent. of our number. This duty we hated more
than any other. One did not mind hard work all day if one’s nights in
camp were undisturbed; but to come in at dark and hardly have time to
off-saddle before being ordered to fall in for outlying picket was simply
ghastly. On some occasions we went out without any food or drink, and
if, as often happens, the post was a long way off and difficult to find in the
dark, one’s fellow messmen were unable to take anything out. Whenever
possible, however, bully-beef or Army rations and biscuits were served out
to the picket before it marched off, and when this was done things were
not so bad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Boer camp fires were seen quite distinctly on the hills close to
where our pickets were, and from the number of these we judged that
the report that the Nek was strongly held was not an exaggerated one.
It is naturally a grand place to defend, and could be made almost
impregnable, I should think, with its high commanding kopjes on either
side. Besides which, it was said to have been strongly fortified by
Colonel Kekewich some time before. We naturally thought, therefore,
that we should have a hard nut to crack next day. Just before dawn,
however, a spy who had been sent into the Boer camp returned with the
news that they had been on the move all night getting away their
baggage, &amp;c., and that they would not offer any very great resistance to
our passage—probably just enough to allow their convoy ample time to
get away. This man, by the way, while returning from the Boer camp
ran into our outlying picket, and, not being prompt in replying to the
sentry’s challenge ‘Who comes there?’ he very nearly got shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report that most of the Boers had stolen away turned out to be
correct, as after a few hours’ shelling to clear the way for our Infantry
the latter advanced practically unopposed, the casualties on either side
being very few, and we got through the Nek about 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> We saw
some very pretty artillery practice, two 5-inch guns coming into action
at a range of three or four miles quite close to where we stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>As De Wet was said to have gone off in the direction of Rustenburg
we pressed forward, got outside that town in the afternoon, and camped
there for the night once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently fresh news of the ‘wily’ one was received, as next day
(August 18) we started back the way we had come and halted in the
afternoon, as if for a long rest, at Sterkstroom, some miles west of Commando
Nek. We had hardly been in camp an hour when the order came
for Mahon’s brigade to saddle up and march at once, the object being to
intercept De Wet, who was reported to have taken up a position near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the Crocodile River. We did a long weary march, the weariness being
accentuated by the fact that we were not allowed to smoke or speak
above a whisper. We halted about 10.30 and camped at a place called
Bokfontein, about five miles west of the Crocodile. I presume it was
not thought advisable to advance any closer for fear of blundering into
the enemy unawares, and thus giving them the chance of getting away
under cover of darkness. With all these precautions and preparations
we naturally thought we were really there or thereabouts this time.
Once again, however, we were baffled of our prey, which we heard next
evening had got away in a north-easterly direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>We arrived at Commando Nek at 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 19th, and it was
then decided that Mahon’s brigade should reconnoitre the kopjes north
of and directly opposite to the Nek, and this we proceeded to do.
General Ian Hamilton had not come up then. On approaching the
position we found that there were two ranges of kopjes lying east and
west (each range being divided again into several little groups of hills),
and through these there was a passage leading to the open country beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>A squadron of the Imperial Light Horse was sent out to scout, and they
presently put up some Boers, but a few shells sent among these soon drove
them back again. Lumsden’s Horse were then ordered to gallop forward and
occupy the first group of kopjes on the western ranges. We had hardly got
into position when we saw a large convoy of Boer waggons making its way,
as fast as the oxen could be goaded to travel, from the kopje on the east
to the plains beyond, and towards another range of kopjes further north.
We immediately sent back word to General Mahon, and he at once
ordered the guns to be brought up, and a few shells were sent after the
convoy. Unfortunately, however, we only had a battery of 12-pounders
with us, and by the time they got into position the convoy had a
long start and our shells fell short. General Mahon reluctantly decided
that it would be unsafe to follow the convoy with the small force at his
disposal, as the Boers had no doubt left a sufficient number of men
behind on the eastern and western ranges of kopjes to cover its retreat.
These kopjes completely commanded the plains beyond, and had we gone
on we should have been absolutely at their mercy and should have been
very roughly handled indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides which, I fancy General Mahon’s orders were merely to
reconnoitre the position and not to run his neck into any kind of noose.
Abandoning all idea of pursuit, therefore, General Mahon then
proceeded to examine the eastern range of kopjes from which the
convoy had started, and where he suspected there might be a Boer
laager. To effect this purpose he sent out the New Zealanders as scouts.
They were allowed to approach within fifty yards without molestation,
when all of a sudden the klik-klok of Mausers was heard all along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>ridge, and an officer and three men were seen to fall. The former died
next day, poor fellow. After this the scouts returned. From our
position on the kopjes on the left we saw the whole thing distinctly. A
party of New Zealanders, before this happened, were examining a farmhouse,
and while they were inside one of their horses got away. The
farmhouse was quite close to the hill from which the Boers were firing,
and when the retirement took place the unfortunate man who had lost
his horse would have been left had not one of his comrades very pluckily
ridden forward and caught the animal, which was grazing close by, and
thus enabled its owner to get away. The plucky scout, however, stayed to
take up, behind his saddle, another man, whose horse had been killed, and
they also managed to get clear off, notwithstanding that they were being
shot at all the while. Captain Taylor, our Adjutant, who was looking
through his telescope at the time, said it was the neatest and coolest
thing he had ever seen. It was now getting on in the afternoon, and, the
purpose for which, as I presume, we were sent out being complete, the
order to retire was given, Lumsden’s Horse being instructed to act as rearguard,
and occupy the kopjes where they were posted, till the guns and
the rest of the troops had got away. This we did, and we heard afterwards
from the men in charge of the ambulance which was left behind to
bring in the wounded that we had hardly left the kopjes we had been on
all day when the Boers occupied them. We got back to our camp at
Commando Nek late in the afternoon, and stayed there for the night.
This was the most irritating action we have yet been in, for the Boer
convoy was at our mercy, but we were not numerically strong enough to
attack it. It thus slipped away under our very noses. Baden-Powell
was at Commando Nek and Ian Hamilton a day’s march in rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was arranged that next day General Mahon’s brigade should make
an attack on the position reconnoitred that morning, supported by Ian
Hamilton, who was to join us again with the rest of his division.
Lumsden’s Horse were to take up the same position as they had done the
day before. The brigade marched out at 6.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> and were soon on
the scene of the previous action. As instructed, we posted ourselves on
the kopjes occupied by us the day before, and in the meantime scouts
were sent out to discover whether or not the Boers were still about. The
crack of Mausers soon decided this question, and the kopjes in front and
on both flanks were then shelled for several hours. We were then
ordered to leave our rocky perches and advance in skirmishing order to
the attack. We soon arrived on the kopjes previously held by the Boers,
but found no trace of these gentry, who had evidently played their
usual game of leaving a few snipers behind to hinder our advance while
their main body got away in safety. This effected, the snipers themselves
vanished into space. There were no casualties on our side that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>morning, and I do not fancy our shells did much damage, as I did not
hear of any dead or wounded Boers being found. It was about here that
De Wet was supposed to have broken up his commando, leaving some
1,500 dismounted men to take refuge in the bushveldt, while he went off
south with only 200 men. Meantime General Ian Hamilton came up with
his troops, and the whole of us then advanced north, the direction taken
by the fleeing Boers into the bushveldt, expecting a fight at any time, which
did not come off. The going was extremely difficult, the soil being impalpable
sand with thorny bushes growing so close together that at twenty
yards objects could not be discerned. Water was only encountered at
one spot, a farm in a valley. The occupants of the farm were a Boer
woman and two little children; she weepingly informed us that the
Boers had commandeered her husband the day before, and, as he had
objected, they had taken him away in handcuffs. We made Zoutpans by
sundown, completely jaded and worn out. At Zoutpans are the salt-mines,
now at a standstill, as the company owning them have gone into liquidation,
and the only house is that in which the manager, an Englishman,
lives. A pool highly impregnated with salt was the only water near
at hand, and on this men and horses had to do. The salt itself from
these mines is only fit for cattle, as soda predominates in it. We had
marched more or less in a circle. Next day we heard that De Wet had
doubled back with 200 picked men to the Free State, leaving the rest
of his force to join Grobler, who was then operating north of Pretoria.
We were told that General Paget was coming up with a small force
along the line of rail, and Baden-Powell, who had left Commando Nek,
would advance parallel with and ten miles west of Paget, and that Ian
Hamilton’s Division, then about twelve miles further west, was to co-operate
with these two columns and keep Grobler from breaking back if
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were now in what is called the bushveldt—<em>i.e.</em>, country covered
with low scrubby bushes. These bushes form excellent screens for the
enemy, and scouting, therefore, is ticklish work. ‘You dunno where you
are,’ as they say. Water was a scarce article, too—in fact, it was about
the driest country we had been in so far. Passing a place called Stinkwater,
we reached Swartzkop late in the evening, and camped there for
the night near a large settlement of the Barotse tribe. The Germans
have a mission in these parts; their church is only a large mud hut, but
the missionary in charge has a following of no fewer than 2,000. We
were told that night that General Ian Hamilton was going with his Staff
to Haaman’s Kraal, a railway station about fifteen miles east, coming
back the same evening, and that Lumsden’s Horse were to act as his escort.
This promised a nice break in the monotony of the everlasting march,
march, march we had been having lately, so those of us who had fit horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>were much elated, the unfortunate ones, who had not, being correspondingly
downcast. As arranged, we started for Haaman’s Kraal at daybreak next
day, and our advance scouts had got quite six miles out when we were
ordered to turn back and return to camp. Trooper Philip Stanley writes
of an incident that occurred at a farm near the German mission, and
which may help to explain how some of the wonderful yarns we so often
heard about De Wet’s capture commenced.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Bourne &amp; Shepherd</em></span><br />PHILIP STANLEY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We were catching the fowls in the houses round the church, and one
particular black-and-white cock evaded all our endeavours. So somebody
called him De Wet, and presently yelled out, as the poor cock was
hurt by a stick or stone, ‘<em>De Wet’s captured at last</em>.’ Curiously enough,
just at that moment a mounted man, a Hussar I think, was riding close
past us on the road and heard the shout ‘De Wet’s captured at last,’ and I
think must have spread the report, as when we got into camp, four miles
on, about an hour and a half afterwards, we were at once told De Wet
was captured at last, and I think they might that evening have added,
‘and eaten.’ Fresh instructions had evidently come from headquarters,
and General Ian Hamilton was not going to Haaman’s Kraal after all.
When we got back to our place we found the division moving off in a
northerly direction, and so, after a few minutes’ halt to water our horses,
we had to follow on as quickly as possible to regain our place in the column—<em>i.e.</em>,
on the flank of the guns. It was a very hot and dirty march, and
towards the afternoon our position was changed to rearguard, which meant
that we had to wait behind till all the stragglers and the whole of the
Transport got into camp. In consequence we did not get in till 8.30 that
night, and even then our troubles were not ended, as several of us were
immediately ordered out on outlying picket. The different corps take it
in turn to do rearguard as a rule, and, needless to say, it is not a popular
duty at all. Generally the rearguard gets off supplying outlying pickets,
but when short-handed, or when there are more posts than usual, they too
have to bear their share of the burden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day’s march (August 24) brought us to Warmbaths. As
its name indicates, there are natural springs here. Some of the enterprising
ones of the earth, taking advantage of this, have erected long rows
of bathing houses supplied with every convenience, hot and cold water
taps, &amp;c., &amp;c., and before the war broke out I understand they were
making a good thing out of it. It was a great resort for invalids, I was
told, and, being on the line of rail from Pretoria, it was quite the thing to
spend a few days out there and take the waters. When we came in we
found the baths entirely deserted, no one being left in charge of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were any number of troops in the place when we arrived,
Paget’s and Baden-Powell’s lot having come in the day before. They had
had several brushes with the enemy under Grobler, and had driven them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>on to the hills beyond the town. As can easily be imagined, there was
a regular rush on the baths, each room being in most cases engaged six
deep. Many of us, in consequence, had to defer tubbing till next day,
which we spent resting in camp. I was one of these. Oh! I shall
never forget the luxury of that bath. I think I spent a whole hour lying
full length in a tub of hot water, with just my chin above the surface.
When one only gets the opportunity of bathing on rare occasions it is
perhaps not surprising that one should wax enthusiastic over one such
as this was. That we hadn’t been used to luxuries was fully demonstrated
by the number of men who were suffering with colds the next
day. We started again with Ian Hamilton on the evening of the 26th,
leaving Generals Paget and Baden-Powell behind to settle with Grobler
and his merry band, whom, as I have written above, they had already
harried considerably. Our march was in the direction of Pretoria, and
everybody in the column then heard for the first time that we were
merely going there to refit and get remounts, after which we should be
sent out in the direction of Middelburg. Alas! for our hopes that this
was to have been our last trek.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twenty-five miles of bushveldt had to be traversed to reach the next
camp, at Pienaar’s River—an eccentric stream, the meandering of which
caused us considerable inconvenience in crossing and re-crossing it a dozen
times during the march. We reached Pienaar’s River station that night
and camped there. Starting again next day, we got to Haaman’s Kraal
about midday, and halted there for two or three hours. We heard here
that our mails (we hadn’t had any since leaving Pretoria at the beginning
of the month, so expected a good pile) had been sent on from Pretoria to
meet us, and they were a mile or two ahead. About a dozen of us
were accordingly sent to get them. There were eight or ten bags for us,
and we immediately ‘buckled to’ the pleasant task of sorting. It took
us a good two hours’ hard work, and this will give some idea of the
number of letters and parcels received.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing our march, we reached Waterval station late in the
afternoon and halted for the night. This, it will be remembered, was
where the Boers kept our men whom they had taken prisoners, after
they removed them from the racecourse at Pretoria. They were
confined in long tin sheds placed in the middle of a large barbed wire
enclosure, and this was lighted up by electric light all night, thus reducing
the chances of escape to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c000'>We marched at 4.30 next morning and at 10 o’clock arrived in
Pretoria, where we camped on the racecourse. Shortly afterwards we
were joined by Captain Clifford and the men (about twenty) who had been
left behind at Irene owing to their having no horses, and also by several
others who had been in hospital and were now convalescent. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the latter was Regimental Sergeant-Major ‘Lump’ Marsham, who was
looking remarkably well after all he had gone through. He had had
some remarkable experiences; shot in two places (through the chest and
right thigh), besides having a bullet through his haversack in our first
fight at Houtnek, then being taken prisoner at Rhenoster River station,
where he was on his way up to rejoin the regiment after leaving hospital,
then having the pleasure of being present at the surrender of Prinsloo
and three or four thousand of his men, and forming one of the guard
which escorted them afterwards. We were all greatly pleased to have him
back among us again.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had had a trying time of it, and Veterinary-Captain Stevenson
cast our horses wholesale, nearly two-thirds being cast in all. The men
seem made of sterner stuff, and campaigning has only tended to make the
majority fitter than ever, and only a very few are ill—a matter of the
survival of the fittest. We have been working in co-operation with
Baden-Powell’s brigade a good deal, and our desire to hear about him and
to see him has been surfeited. The only hardship experienced on the
march was want of good tobacco. Though the Magaliesberg tobacco is
considered the best of Transvaal tobacco, and we could have obtained
plenty of it, yet few among us have acquired a taste for it. It is
positively vile, and an Indian cigar when smoked in a pipe is probably the
nearest approach to it. Some more changes have taken place among us.
Trooper Arathoon (Oudh Light Horse) has been granted a commission in
the 3rd Dragoon Guards, Corporal Montagu-Bates one in the East Surrey
Regiment, Trooper Partridge one in the Northumberland Fusiliers, and
Trooper Douglas-Jones one in the Army Service Corps. Corporal
Chartres has for some months been doing duty as Surgeon-Captain at
one of our many hospitals. Trooper Follett died of enteric at Johannesburg,
while quite twenty or twenty-five men have been invalided home.
There is little doubt that a famine in the Transvaal will result from this
war; foodstuffs are at a premium, while the expected crops have been all
destroyed. In the large towns like Pretoria, Johannesburg, &amp;c., bread is
only baked from flour supplied by Government, and even then the
prevailing price is a shilling for a pound loaf. Every-day necessities, such
as tea, coffee, and sugar, are now hard to procure, while beet has risen
to two shillings a pound; mealies (Indian-corn) for horses cannot be
bought under threepence the pound. The beginning of a famine would
thus be the precursor of the end of the war. Glancing at a map, one
would be inclined to think places indicated in capitals and small capitals
to be important towns; as a matter of fact each is but a cluster of houses,
a store or two, the inevitable church, and an hotel. This is typical of places
like Rustenburg, Heilbron, Middelburg, Carolina, &amp;c. Kroonstad, Brandfort
and Pretoria are but larger clusters, more hotels, and more churches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The latter certainly possess some really excellent public buildings; the
private villas are charming, and suggest the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>otium cum dignitate</em></span>, while
the State artillery barracks are reputed to be the finest in the world.
Johannesburg is the one town of the Transvaal, and can hold its own
against the world. But it must not be forgotten that the Uitlander alone
has made it what it is. As a sink of iniquity it has the unenviable
distinction of ranking second only to San Francisco. Gambling saloons
abut on to the streets, and at some gambling is restricted to gold alone.
One can imagine what Johannesburg must have been under a corrupt
Government, such as the one we have just displaced—the Rand, a
succession of gold-mines, being practically suburban. Johannesburg
sports a public-house at every fifty yards, and it is the refuse of the Rand
that forms the nucleus of the band of outlaws and desperadoes known as
the Irish Brigade <em>alias</em> Blake’s Ruffians. The very antithesis of this
contingent are known as the Imperial Light Horse, who have been so
highly complimented by Sir George White as constituting the finest
fighting men in the world.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Very characteristic of the dashing and humorous leader under
whom Lumsden’s Horse served in this march is the following
story told by Captain Beresford:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>I remember one very wet cold day when we were attached to Mahon’s
column. While on the march a sergeant and two men were told off to
go and forage for some provisions. Coming across a Boer farm, they helped
themselves to a turkey or two and some poultry. Now, it happened that
General Ian Hamilton the day previous had paid for what his men took,
so the Boer was loud in his protestation, but all the satisfaction he could
get from our men was, ‘The General will pay.’ General Mahon passing
shortly after, the man presented his bill, which amounted to fifteen shillings.
On seeing it the General made inquiries as to which corps the foraging
party belonged to, and being told, sent for an officer of the corps and
requested <em>him</em> to pay the bill; but as the officer had not fifteen shillings
about him, the General very kindly lent him the money till he could
obtain it from his brother-officers and men, who found out then that the
General would not be universal provider.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>After such a march, in which horses had become so emaciated
by want of sufficient food to sustain them, and so leg-weary from
incessant work under heavy burdens, that more than two-thirds
of them were temporarily unfit for service, the corps naturally expected
to get a long rest at Pretoria. Nearly every man needed
it too, and welcomed the prospect of a little town life in touch
with civilisation, where some luxuries might be enjoyed and
experiences exchanged with comrades from other columns.
Ragged and out at heels from <a id='corr313.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>being having marched</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_313.12'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>being having marched</ins></a></span> long
distances through tangled growth of rhenoster bushes and ‘wait-a-bit’
thorns to relieve their exhausted steeds, these troopers
naturally looked forward to the chance of clothing themselves in
comfort if the stores of Pretoria should be equal to that demand,
or at any rate of waiting until articles of much-needed kit could
be got up from the bases where these things had been left. Such
expectations were natural enough in the case of men who began
to think there would be no more need of their services, since Lord
Roberts had expressed an opinion that regular warfare was
nearly at an end. Circumstances seemed then to justify that
view. Though De Wet was still at large, he did not count for
much while his followers were scattered in all directions with little
chance of coming together again. Botha’s forces, offering but a
feeble resistance at any point, had been pushed further and
further eastward by Generals French and Pole-Carew, operating
in their front, and the army of Natal on their flank. Buller had
fought his brilliant action at Bergendal, where Lord Roberts
considered the success decisive, saying: ‘It was carried out in
view of the main Boer position, and the effect of it was such
that the enemy gave way at all points, flying in confusion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>north and east. Next morning Buller was able to occupy
Machadodorp without opposition.’ Dundonald’s brigade of
Irregular Cavalry had pushed on in pursuit of the Boers through
mountainous country, where they made no stand against him.
Buller, continuing his march, occupied Waterval Boven, where
the prisoners released from Nooitgedacht joined him. President
Kruger and other members of the late Transvaal Government were
at Nelspruit preparing for flight across the Portuguese frontier;
and General French was at Carolina, waiting only for reinforcements
to make his swoop on Barberton by way of the last stronghold
that remained in the enemy’s hands south of the Delagoa
Bay Railway. It looked, indeed, as if Boer resistance on any
organised scale must be near its final stage, and the thoughts
of Lumsden’s Horse naturally turned towards home rather than
to opportunities for gaining fresh distinction. Their hopes of
immediate peace with honour were, however, doomed to disappointment.
Before they had been in Pretoria many hours
orders for a fresh move had reached them, and, instead of having
leisure for relaxation or even a taste of civilisation’s comforts, they
had to spend the next day in drawing from stores the outfit of
which they were sorely in need and making other preparations
for their march. Their Brigadier-General (Mahon) was to go in
command of reinforcements for General French, and the troops
placed at his disposal were M Battery Royal Horse Artillery,
the 3rd Corps of Mounted Infantry, Queensland Mounted
Infantry, New Zealand Mounted Rifles, 79th Company Imperial
Yeomanry, the Imperial Light Horse, and Lumsden’s Horse.
The order came to them in a form which left no doubt in any
mind that there was still a man’s work to be done, and that they
were about to take part in another important phase of the great
Boer war. Therefore they put aside all vain regrets for the
things that were just then out of reach. Disappointment gave
place quickly to gratification at the thought that they were to
see service under such a dashing leader as General French, who
had never up to that time met the Boers without bringing them
to action, and whose reputation rose higher after every enterprise
undertaken by him, though he was not always allowed to take
full advantage of a success by following up his beaten enemies.
The Boers, who attributed every British success in the Free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>State and Transvaal to luck or to overwhelming numbers, had
given to French the title of the ‘lucky General.’ They said it
was by luck alone that he beat Commandant Koch at Elandslaagte
before their reinforcements could come up. Luck, according
to them, served him again in the hour of his secret
withdrawal from Colesberg just before De la Rey’s plans for annihilation
were complete, and yet again when he made his dash at
interposing forces north of Modder River, and, striking at the
very point where they were weakest, got through just in the nick
of time, took their positions in reverse, and thus cleared a way
for the relief of Kimberley. If all this can be called luck, then it
is something to be a lucky general and goes a long way in
justification of the faith that Napoleon placed in men who had
that reputation. At any rate, no Boer commandos were very
eager to get in the way of ‘lucky French,’ and whenever he was
known to be operating on their flank they always thought it time
to summon thither one of their own Generals most trusted for
his ability to conduct a retreat. That luck fell more than once
to De la Rey’s lot. In a recent conversation that redoubtable
leader, the best fighting man of all on the Boer side, told the
Editor of this History that it was he who opposed French at
Driefontein after Cronjé’s surrender. He also had to fight all
the rearguard actions up to the time of our crossing the Vaal,
when he went off in hot haste for the purpose of intercepting
Mahon’s column before it could reach Mafeking. Having been
out-man&oelig;uvred there, he was called back to aid Botha outside
Johannesburg, and entrusted again with the task of delaying
French’s flanking movement by the defence of Klipriviersberg
until the Boer guns and convoys could make good their retreat.
Obviously they did not think it safe to trust anything to chance
when our ‘lucky General’ was pressing them, but sent their
wiliest tactician and most stubborn fighter to hold him in play
while they cleared off. If any of them really believed in their
capacity to beat French on equal terms—the advantage of ground
being with them to counterbalance British superiority in
numbers—an admirable opportunity offered in the mountainous
ranges of the Devil’s Kantoor, where, Boer leaders had frequently
declared, they would crush any force attempting to reach
Barberton that way. If properly held, the positions there would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>have been almost impregnable. Few people to this day know
the difficulties that French had before him when he concentrated
his force at Carolina. The Boers knew all about these things.
Every zig-zag track like a winding stair up the precipitous
mountain-side was familiar to them. They knew also the object
with which he was waiting to gather strength at Carolina, and
they brought forces against him that were little inferior
numerically to his own. Yet when at last he struck straight for
almost inaccessible mountain passes, instead of making a wide
detour to get round them, they were so paralysed by the ‘lucky
General’s’ audacity that they let him have his way, which led by
the nearest track to Barberton. This slight digression, however,
anticipates events which may now be dealt with more fully in
the narratives by Colonel Lumsden, his officers and troopers,
whose experiences and observations are woven together in
the following description of events in something like proper
sequence:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We were by this time reduced to forty fit horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our stay in Pretoria, as we had heard it would be, was only a short
one. The day after arriving in camp we were served out with new kit,
of which we were sadly in need, most of the men being in a very ragged
condition indeed. General Mahon was to proceed to Carolina and join
General French’s division there, leaving General Ian Hamilton’s division,
to which we were no longer attached. It rained heavily the night before
we started, and as we marched at daybreak there was no time to dry our
blankets, which were simply sopping wet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our total muster on parade was—A Company 17, B Company 24; in all,
41 rank-and-file. The balance of nearly 100 men, under Captain Beresford,
were to follow on receipt of remounts, and overtake us if possible. This
hope was soon knocked on the head, for while headquarters started with
General Mahon for Barberton, the remainder were sent to Machadodorp,
which they reached without much adventure a fortnight later. Notwithstanding
their repeated attempts to join us, their wishes were not acceded
to, the country being considered too dangerous for a small party to move
alone. On the 31st we reached Bronkhurst Spruit, memorable in the
Transvaal as the spot where British troops, under Colonel Anstruther,
were badly cut up in the last war, while marching, all unconscious that
war had been declared against the Transvaal. On September 1 we passed
Balmoral and camped at Elandsfontein. On the 2nd, near the Transvaal
and Delagoa Bay coal-mines, a French gentleman was good enough
to communicate the latest Boer lie. It was that China was sending a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>million of troops to invade England. The country about here is very
treacherous, with many swamps which unwary troopers may not see
until they are floundering in mire, where their horses sink to the girths.
Our camp that night was at Reitspruit, six miles from Middelburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day we passed Middelburg, which proved a grievous disappointment,
for there was absolutely nothing in the way of provisions
procurable, and camped at Reitpan. The weather was very hot, the sun
striking down with great force during the middle of the day. General
Mahon had adopted the plan of off-saddling and halting for two or three
hours during the heat of the day, instead of marching steadily from 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
to 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> with short halts of ten minutes every now and then. This
gave man and beast a thorough rest, and the opportunity was always
taken of making tea and coffee, and partaking of this with the inevitable
jam and biscuits. The horses, too, had a good feed of oats, which were
served out in the morning and carried in our nosebags. Captain Noblett
got a nasty touch of the sun two or three days before arriving at
Middelburg, and the doctors decided that he ought to go into hospital
there, being quite unfit to continue on the march. We were very sorry
to lose him, as he was one of our most popular officers. Speaking
for No. 2 Section B Company, anyhow, I know they swore by him to
a man. We heard afterwards that he had gone to Durban for a
change, and it is to be hoped he will soon be back again with us. The
fourth day’s march brought us in contact with General Hutton’s line
of communications, and we were apprised of the annexation of the
Transvaal. With this good news we buoyed ourselves up, and brought
a dreary march to a close at Wonderfontein. The Boers are whimsical
at names, but have surpassed themselves with Wonderfontein, for the
wonder of it is where to find the fountain? Speculation was rife, as the
pools of water we saw were so putrid that the horses, though they had
done thirteen miles from the last halting-place, would not drink till
accident disclosed a tiny spring in a bed of sand, just deep enough to fill
a coffee cup at a time. Here was the wonder, and, <em>eureka</em>! we had struck
it. The 5th was an eventful day, for when we had marched eastward
three miles a heliogram from a contingent of 90 Canadians on the line
of communications solicited help, as they were hard pressed by 300 Boers
near Pan station, where they had been fighting since daybreak. Files
about and canter was the order, and we went back some six miles to
their aid, but the enemy had beaten a retreat after capturing a small post,
where they crept up through a dense fog and surprised the helpless
picket. We returned to Wonderfontein, and General Mahon, in consideration
of the call made on us, very generously ordered an issue of a
quarter of a pound of bully-beef and a biscuit. ’Twas lunch <em>à la
South Africa</em>, and much appreciated. Thus refreshed we continued on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>our march for some five or six miles, and camped for the night. Such a
night we have never had. The wind blew a perfect hurricane, and it was
bitterly cold. On the 6th the brigade reached Carolina, and we were in
expectation of seeing a town where we could renew our diminished stock
of provisions, but, alas! Carolina in Africa is very different from the
Carolina of the song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>South Carolina is a sultry clime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the niggers work in the summer time,</div>
      <div class='line'>Massa in the shade would lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>While we poor niggers work all day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With us it was not summer time, but Massa had to lie on the bleak veldt
and pretty hungry too. We found General French in camp near by us,
with two brigades. A foreign commando of Austrians and Italians was
said to be in the neighbourhood, and we hoped to become better acquainted
with it later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carolina is a small uninteresting sort of place, more a village than
anything else, the houses being small and built of corrugated iron. It
is about the windiest place I have ever been in. We were there nearly
a week, and it blew a hurricane almost all the time. One day it rained as
well, and this made it horribly cold—the chilly blast cutting into one like
a knife. Even the hardy Cape ponies, who had never before in their lives
known what it was to be blanketed, had to be covered up that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of the charms of this delightful place is that it is most
dangerous to send horses out grazing on the surrounding veldt, as there
is a low poisonous bush which grows pretty plentifully on it, to eat which
is almost certain death. We found this out by bitter experience, losing
four or five horses before we left.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first march from Carolina took us over a ridge by Nelspruit, where
we witnessed a very pretty engagement. The enemy had taken up a
position on top of a hill crossed by three deep ravines at right angles to
our line of advance. This was stormed by the Suffolk Infantry while we
acted as escort to the guns, which shelled the enemy severely as they left
the shelter of the last ridge. When turned out of their last stronghold
they retired by ones and twos under severe shrapnel fire at 1,500 yards’
range, which gave us an object-lesson in Mounted Infantry tactics. At
Carolina, with General French and his Cavalry, we halted two days, and
resumed our advance on Sunday the 9th. We had heard that the Boers
were in the vicinity, and it was not long before we met them. For
about six miles we marched across the absolutely flat veldt, and then
with extraordinary suddenness the scene changed, and we found ourselves
among steep and rugged hills. Here was ideal country for the Boers
to fight in, and they speedily let us know of their presence. They had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>taken up a strong position among rocks and piled-up boulders on the further
side of a hollow some 3,000 yards across. ‘Lumsden’s,’ together with a
part of a squadron of the 18th Hussars who, like ourselves, had been
unable to get remounts in Pretoria, so that their numbers were reduced
about 60 per cent., were escorting the guns. M Battery R.H.A. swung
‘action front’ and had opened fire in next to no time, the whole battery and
also two 15-pounders being placed in line along the ridge and all pounding
away at the rocky kopje, or rather series of kopjes, from which the Boers
were firing at our Infantry (the Suffolk Regiment), who now opened out,
and, advancing to within good rifle range, took what cover they could find
and engaged the enemy. It was a grand sight watching the play of the guns,
and cheer after cheer rang through the lines as each shot fell in rapid
succession right in among the Boers, scattering them like startled sheep.
The guns did splendid work; the range was accurate, and the shells perfect.
But a grander sight still was to watch Tommy advancing: he does it in a
most casual way, with his rifle slung at ease over his shoulder. You see
individuals in khaki stumbling over rocks and boulders, then a thin line
of khaki in the distance, then nothing, for Tommy is resting; the thin
khaki line again becomes visible as he proceeds in the coolest manner
in the world, till the order to fire is given. Nothing is then visible, but
the sounds of volley after volley and independent firing tell you the Infantry
are in the thick of a fight. As the Mounted Infantry advance through the
gaps in their lines, Tommy cheerily calls out, ‘Let ’em have it ’ot, mate.’
Having placed our horses in a nullah out of the way of stray bullets—one
or two of which came whistling overhead—we had nothing to do but
watch the progress of the fight, and a capital view we had, especially of
our artillery in action; the enemy had no guns in position here, so our
guns could devote themselves to shelling the rocks among which the
Boers were lying; the boulders afforded them excellent cover, and they
stuck to it exceedingly well. The weak point in their position lay in the
fact that the cover of which they had taken advantage was half-way
down the near side of the slope, so in the event of their being forced to
retire they would have to ride (or run) up three or four hundred yards of
bare hillside before they topped the ridge. For about five hours the
fight continued. By this time our Infantry had got comparatively close,
and the Boers decided not to wait for them. Suddenly they were seen
issuing from the dip where their horses had been hidden in twos and
threes and batches of various sizes, and scattering up the hillside. With
the naked eye one could see little black dots streaming away in all directions;
it looked for all the world like a disturbed ants’ nest. The guns
now redoubled their exertions, loading and firing all they knew, the shells
dropping in every direction among the retreating Boers. In retiring they
had to go down to the bottom of the dip, where they had left their horses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and up the slope on the other side—a distance of about 300 yards, I
should say. When once they got to the top of this slope they were more
or less safe, as they could take cover among the rocks there and get
away to the hilly country beyond. But while going up the slope they
were quite exposed to the fire from our batteries. General Mahon was
there in person, giving instructions to the officer in charge of the guns,
which were kept playing on the spot as fast as the gunners could load
and fire. Watching through glasses we could see three or four bowled
over; they must have had an uncomfortable ride until they topped the
ridge, though probably not many were hit, as we know from our own experience
how ineffective even a well-directed shell fire often is. However,
on crossing over we found where one dead Boer had been hastily buried,
also a dead horse and other signs that our shell fire had not been without
results. A long-range 15-pounder of the Boers now came into action, and
for about an hour before sundown shelled our convoy at extreme range
without doing any damage. Throughout the day the Cavalry had been
engaged on our right and had suffered some casualties. Our brigade had
had half-a-dozen or so; one of the Imperial Yeomanry was killed and two
were wounded, and three of the Imperial Light Horse were wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon we advanced and occupied the position previously
held by the Boers, who had retreated some distance. They had a long-range
15-pounder with them, and they treated us to a few shells; but
these went high over our heads, and burst a long way behind without
doing any damage. Shortly after this, as it was getting dark, we
camped for the night. As we were preparing to camp the Boers
shelled our convoy with a Long Tom they still possess, but their shells
fell wide and were harmless. We camped for the night at Buffalo
Spruit. The casualties were nine wounded Scots Greys, one wounded
Imperial Horse; Boers about fifteen killed, wounded unknown. The
10th was an uneventful day, but on the 11th Lumsden’s Horse supplied an
outlying picket consisting of our entire strength. Through some error
the picket manned the wrong kopje, and as they could not be found next
morning were reported as captured. We turned up, however, late in the
day at the camp on the Komati River, and followed rapidly in the track of the
advancing troops. We were now on half-rations, with De Kaap Mountains
looming before us, the roadway being in places as steep as one in eight,
and the enemy strongly posted along the summit. On the 12th the advance
was made at 5.30 <span class='fss'>A.M</span>., and by 9 <span class='fss'>A.M</span>. M Battery was again pounding away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road to Barberton slopes gradually up from the plains round
Carolina for about 3,000 feet, if I remember right, when it takes a sudden
upward turn for about a couple of miles before reaching the top of De
Kaap Mountains, over which it winds, and then descends again about
2,000 to 3,000 feet, the town being situated in a hollow surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>hills on all sides. The last bit of a couple of miles or so is what is
called the Devil’s Kantoor. The gradient is about one in four, as far as
I could judge, and this will give some idea of the job our Generals had
to tackle if the Boers elected to hold this place, as it was reported
they were going to do. It was simply an ideal place to defend, and they
were said to have a Long Tom in position—so things generally looked
uncomfortable, to say the least of it. Scouting that day looked like
being an even poorer game than usual. Anything but a demoralised
force would have made a strong stand in such a position. The main
advance was against its front, while the Cavalry executed a turning
movement to the right, with such effect that the position was gained
almost without a shot. The climb was terrific. So bad was it that
12-pounders only just managed to get up with double teams, and all the
baggage had to be left at the foot of the hill. The troops, however,
pushed on to the top, only to witness a heart-rending sight. On the
range opposite, at about 8,000 yards, was a high laager half a mile square,
a dense mass of cattle and waggons, out of which the latter were seen
streaming away towards Swaziland. Between us and them lay a deep
valley, while the road curving round to the left was commanded by three
guns, rendering serious attack in that direction inadvisable. The Imperial
Light Horse made a gallant attempt to get round, but were not strong
enough. We all looked to see the 6-inch gun come up and play havoc
with the laager, but the naval officer in command declared his oxen
unable to bring the gun up the precipitous ascent, leaving us the
mortification of seeing the enemy escape under our very eyes. It was
some gratification, however, to eventually capture twenty-five of their
‘buck waggons,’ many thousand sheep, and some oxen.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time we had dragged up our guns and got them into position
the fugitives were out of range, as a few shells sent in their direction
proved; but the captured waggons contained stores of various kinds,
sugar, flour, &amp;c., and this made a welcome addition to our commissariat,
which was running very short of supplies. It took four days to get the
whole of the Transport up the Devil’s Kantoor. During this time the
bulk of the division halted, as they could not move without supplies.</p>

<p class='c000'>To form some estimate of the difficulties of transport up these mountains,
I would mention that the Boers were confident that we could never
get our convoy and guns up, for among them the steepest part is described
as a place where, if a leading team of oxen come to a stop they are hurled
back on to the waggon. To clear these mountains in four days reflects
the greatest credit on that much-abused department, the Transport.
Sergeant Power, of Lumsden’s Horse, excelled on the occasion, for, fearing
he could not possibly get the troopers’ blanket-carts up that night, he
unloaded the carts and used the mules with pack saddles, thus enabling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Lumsden’s Horse to sleep with blankets when the rest of the brigade
were blanketless, poor fellows! In such circumstances it needs no
telling that we went to sleep supperless, as our rations were at the foot of
the mountain and the troops on its summit. Directly the road was
clear General French with two Cavalry brigades advanced rapidly, and,
leaving the Boers, who were retreating southwards, alone, he pushed on
to Barberton, some fifteen miles distant. Guided by one of the Imperial
Light Horsemen, he avoided the road down into the plain in which
Barberton is situated (which road—so it is said—the enemy were quite
prepared to defend), and using a bridle-path across the hills, supposed to
be impracticable for horses, he descended suddenly on the town and
captured it without opposition. The enemy were completely surprised
and fled, leaving fifty-seven engines with rolling-stock standing in the
station, a large quantity of stores, and 10,000<em>l.</em> in specie. The day
following General French’s occupation of the town a Boer convoy consisting
of fifty waggons walked in under the impression that it was still
in their hands! General Mahon’s brigade, with the Infantry, were left to
guard Homolomo while the convoy came up. The gradient was something
like one in four, so you can imagine what a business it was
getting the heavy waggons up. Twelve and fourteen horses were
required to get the lighter guns up, while the naval gun had eighty
oxen harnessed to it, and many a poor beast fell out and died under the
strain. On the third day we continued our march; all day we were
descending, gradually leaving the hills behind, until we eventually came
out into an enormous plain, the Kaap Valley. Here we halted and
waited for the Transport, who had had another trying day. We had
descended 3,000 feet during the day, and the difference in temperature
was most noticeable. In this part of the country the hot weather is just
beginning; the nights are quite mild and the sun at midday is scorching.
On Sunday the 16th we marched to within a couple of miles of the town
and camped. It is a straggling little place built close under and partly on
the lower slopes of a spur of the Kaapsche Berg. This is a well watered
part of the country, and fruit growing appears to be a paying industry,
Pretoria and Johannesburg being markets where—in normal times—any
quantity of fruit is easily disposed of. On the fruit farms here we noticed
several old Indian friends—viz., plantains, pineapples, and papiya.
When we got into Barberton we found that General French had gone
on towards Komati Poort, on the Portuguese border, in which direction
the Boers had fled, and we heard shortly afterwards that about 3,000 of
them had taken refuge in Lourenço Marques, having given up their
arms and destroyed a number of their big guns before crossing the
border.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Barberton is quite an Indian town in many respects. Not only is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Madrassi native common, but mango, banana, loquat, fig, and other
Indian fruit trees abound. East Africa seems to my mind to be the
Indian coolie’s Eldorado, for not only does he wax fat and opulent, but he
abandons his Indian garb and struts about in that of Western civilisation.
He does not get on well with the Kaffir, but has pushed himself forward,
and now occupies a higher position among white men than he would
presume to in India.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all other respects, however, Barberton is a very English town, and
owes its origin to the De Kaap Goldfields. It was here that the Boers
housed the women and children who were sent to them from Johannesburg
and Pretoria, and in consequence every house in the town is packed full
of these refugees. It was also at Barberton that the Dorset Yeomanry
and the remaining British prisoners were confined after their removal
from Nooitgedacht; at present the improvised place of confinement
is being used as a prison for the Boers themselves. The latest official
bulletin announces the complete demoralisation of the Boer army,
which is termed a rabble, and speculation is rife as to the probable
date of our disbandment. Last night (22nd) it was announced in orders
that anyone desirous of joining the Pretoria Police at 10<em>s.</em> a day could do
so at once; the chances of a commission at the end of three months
were held out, but only four names were given in. The majority
intend going to England. A very few have decided to remain in Africa,
while some twenty or thirty, chiefly coffee planters from Southern India,
are returning to India. The summer is on us, and the days are very hot—102°
in the shade. We have no tents, but the ingenious ones erect a
bivouac of blankets supported on posts and rifles as a shelter from the sun.
Yesterday a cricket match was played between French’s and Mahon’s
brigades, resulting in an easy win for the latter. Sergeant Pratt
represented Lumsden’s Horse in Mahon’s team.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another correspondent writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Besides the usual camp duties, we had to supply outlying pickets and
patrols turn about with the other Volunteers and Regular regiments.
Twenty or thirty of us used to be sent out to a post five or six miles out
in the morning. From these posts we sent out patrols, forage parties,
&amp;c., during the day, and outlying pickets at night. One of these posts
was situated right on the top of one of the hills beyond the town. It
was a tremendous climb, and took most of us at least an hour to get to it.
Lugging blankets, coats, and rations up there was no joke, and I am
glad to say we only had to do it once during our stay.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a beautiful wood, with a nice mountain stream running
through it, about a mile and a half from camp, where we used to send our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>horses down to graze and water, and we always took the opportunity of
having a delightful bathe or of washing clothes, at which we were by this
time becoming experts. A daily bath was a luxury we had not been
accustomed to before for months, so we appreciated it accordingly. After
our bath we lounged under the shade of the trees till it was time to take
the horses back to camp again. Grazing guard in these circumstances
was rather a favourite duty, as up in camp it was fearfully hot, our only
protection from the sun being small blanket shelter tents, which were not
really much good. These tents were made out of two blankets, or a blanket
and a waterproof sheet. The blankets and waterproof sheets served out to
the Army have eyelet-holes on both sides and at the ends, so one can put
up a tent very easily and quickly, all the materials required being a few
pegs (easily cut from an old biscuit-box or from any other wood which
may be obtainable), a little string, and a couple of rifles, these last
forming the supports at either end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the great heat, we move the position of our camps once a week.
What with dead horses and cattle the air is absolutely putrid, and ’tis a
precaution most imperative. On the march the foul smells encountered
are terrible, owing to the number of dead horses and cattle lying on the
highway. From Pretoria to Balmoral we passed as many as two or
three hundred carcases in different stages of decomposition. The very
water is often polluted, and considerable inconvenience is the consequence.
In a previous letter I incidentally mentioned veldt fires, but at
the Crocodile River camp it was our luck to be in the thick of one, and
that at midnight. We had made the camp at sundown, and as darkness
set in we were enraptured with the pyrotechnic display of the surrounding
kopjes on fire. It was a magnificent sight, though awful. By
10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the camp was hushed in slumber except for stable pickets, when
the wind shifted and blew the flames towards the camp. Gradually the
veldt near us took fire, till at midnight we were completely surrounded.
The roar was appalling, while myriads of insects filled the air. The situation
was one needing immediate action, as every moment was precious.
‘Stand to your horses and saddle up,’ were the orders anxiously given.
All was confusion—men hurriedly folding up blankets, &amp;c., Kaffir boys
running about conducting oxen to inspan, bodies of men running towards
the fast approaching flames carrying blankets to beat them down.
In the midst of all a patrol of the 18th Hussars were seen completely
cut off from the camp and surrounded with flaming veldt. A rush was
made, and hundreds of blankets soon cleared a space, and the patrol
emerged, the horses showing every sign of terror. It was an anxious
time, but in half an hour all was safe, and the flames had been
successfully diverted from their course of destruction. Such a fire in the
back veldt it would have been impossible to cope with. On the western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>veldt these fires destroy complete herds of cattle annually, and are much
dreaded.</p>

<p>THE LAUNDRY<br /><span class='small'>(<em>From a sketch by J.S. Cowen</em>)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One day at Barberton four of us were on observation post when four
Boers came along the road; they were immediately challenged and told to
show their passes, which they did; they then sat down to rest alongside
us. One of them, named Meyers, could talk English perfectly, and when
he found we were of Lumsden’s Horse he said he had escorted one of our
fellows from Ospruit to Pretoria a prisoner, and shared two bottles of
whisky. He then told us the Boers knew exactly, when we were at
Spytfontein, how many men went on picket every night, and how many
we were all told. He also said on April 30 the brigade adjutant rode up
within twenty yards of him. He shouted to Williams to surrender, and
he shouted back, ‘I am damned if I do,’ and galloped off; Meyers fired
all his magazine at the English officer, but missed him. Lieutenant
Williams has since been killed at Bothaville.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barberton was simply crammed with stores of all sorts, the Boers
having used it as a supply depôt for some time past. It was a great
treat being able to get luxuries in the shape of extra sugar, tea, coffee,
sweets, &amp;c., again after such an age, and at reasonable rates too.
Pretoria was entirely denuded of these things, and I remember hunting
without success round the whole town for sugar the day before we left on
our last march. Matches were not to be had there at any price, whereas
here we could buy them at sixpence a dozen boxes. I think we appreciated
these more than anything else. We had felt the want of them tremendously
during the past two or three months. English tobacco, unfortunately,
was unobtainable, so we had to content ourselves with the Boer
variety—a very poor substitute, I think most of us agreed, though I
dare say when one got accustomed to it one would prefer it. Personally
I never want to see or smell the beastly stuff again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barberton itself is a small gold-mining town situated at the bottom
of De Kaap Mountains, and more or less surrounded by hills. On the
hills forming its background are the various mines which were opened out
when gold was first discovered here. Then came the rush of the Rand
mines, and Barberton was left standing. The roads leading to these
mines wind up and round the hillsides, and must have taken months and
months of hard work to complete, I should think. The houses are built
of wood and roofed with corrugated iron for the most part, and are very
small. One wonders how people manage to exist in them in the summer
months, when the temperature is almost if not quite as high as it is in
India, and damp to boot.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was getting very hot before we left early in October, and the old
familiar limp feeling which began to pervade all ranks brought back
memories of hot weather in India. Barberton is essentially a British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>town, and until lately, when the Boers used it as a city of refuge for their
wives and families, the inhabitants were practically all British by blood
if not by birth. The community must have been a fairly rough one in
the old days, and one can imagine many wild orgies taking place among
the miners, more or less cut off, as they were, from civilisation. Fruits
of all sorts grow here, Indian as well as English—plantains, gooseberries,
oranges, lemons, strawberries—and vegetables too. Beautiful oat-hay for
our horses was obtainable in the fields for the first week or so that we
were in Barberton.</p>

<p class='c000'>You will be sorry to hear of the death from enteric fever at Johannesburg
Hospital of Private M. Follett, the elder of the two brothers—planters—who
joined with the Mysore contingent. Since then, I regret to say,
we have had another death from disease—that of Private J.H. Maclaine
(Surma Valley Light Horse), who died of acute pneumonia in Pretoria
Hospital. Transport Driver Martyn some months ago was run over and
badly injured. We are sorry to hear that he has since died of the injuries
he then received. One way and another a good many have left the
regiment. A certain number of those left behind, sick and wounded,
have been unable to rejoin the regiment and have been invalided
home, among them Privates Cooper and Butler, from Madras, both of
whom were taken ill at Kroonstad, the former suffering from pneumonia
and the latter from pleurisy; also Private Bewsher, from Mysore, who was
wounded in the knee at Elandsfontein station two days before the surrender
of Johannesburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our ten days at Barberton gave a welcome rest after many weary
marches. The time was enlivened with dances and hunting with buckhounds
for the officers and cricket for whoever could be spared. It
was here that Colonel Lumsden had his unfortunate accident. He was
riding back in the dark from afternoon tea at a neighbouring camp,
and, being deceived by the light of a picket fire, rode straight into
a nullah. The picket, luckily for him, heard the noise of the fall, and by
the light of a candle went in search, finding horse and man prostrate.
The horse was dead and Colonel Lumsden insensible. The good fellows,
however, did their best, and, taking him up to the fire, discovered by his
badges that he belonged to Lumsden’s Horse. One of them came into
our camp to report, bringing us the information about 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> The
doctor and ambulance immediately proceeded to the scene of the accident,
and, patching him up temporarily, took him away to the Boer hospital in
Barberton. By the light of day it appeared wonderful that anyone could
have escaped death from such an accident. The nullah may almost be
described as a fissure in the ground some 15 feet wide and 29½(measured)
deep. The only thing that saved our Colonel’s life was that the horse
evidently alighted on his feet, taking the brunt of the fall himself and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>paying the penalty with his life; this was shown by the fact that the
saddle was not injured in any way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden writes of this incident in a letter from
Barberton Hospital dated October 1, 1900:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Well, eight days ago I visited town, and was riding back to my camp
at dusk when my charger, a splendid paced and mannered Cape horse,
simply cantered right into a donga 30 feet deep, breaking his neck in
the fall, while I lay by his side bruised and insensible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily for me, some pickets were close by and heard the smash.
Recognising me by my badge, they went to my camp and brought our
doctor and adjutant to the spot. They took me to our camp for treatment,
and in a few hours’ time our doctor, with the assistance of troopers who
volunteered to carry the stretcher, conveyed me into the Barberton
Club, the temporary Boer hospital, ours being both full up. The Boer
doctor and nurses have been kindness itself to me, and have done everything
in their power to make me comfortable. How I escaped with my
life my usual good luck only knows. I was bashed, cut, and bruised, but
not a limb or a bone broken. Four days ago I nearly snuffed out from
a flow of blood from my nose and mouth, but fortunately it was stopped
in time, and I really believe did me good, as I had too much blood in
my system. Now, more than enough about myself. I am on the right
track, and hope to be with my men in a few days more. I follow on with
the hospital train the day after to-morrow, and pick them up at Machadodorp,
for which place they leave to-day. There we pick up Captain
Beresford with 100 of my men. They stayed at Pretoria a day beyond
us to get remounts, came on with my friend General Cunningham’s
Infantry Division, and were never able to rejoin us, we being in advance
with General Mahon’s Mounted Brigade.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Months afterwards, Colonel Lumsden, by the following tribute,
showed that he had not forgotten those who had tended him with
so much care:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>To incidents which I have already related of kindly treatment at the
hands of Boer doctors and nurses I may add another of which I was on
this occasion the recipient. I awoke the morning after my serious
accident feeling very stiff and sore, and found myself lying in the general
ward amid wounded Tommies and Boers. I must have been insensible
for nearly twelve hours. Next day Dr. Powell, our regimental doctor,
wished to remove me to one of our own hospitals, but Dr. Bidenhamp,
the Boer doctor, offered to give me a small room to myself if I remained,
which I gratefully accepted, and could not have wished for better care or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>attention than I received at his hands and those of his assistant, Mr. E.E.
Haumann. I have also to thank very gratefully Sister Alma Meyer, of
Grosvenor House, Stellenbosch, for the kindly treatment she accorded me,
as well as two Dutch sisters from Holland who were assisting her in the
hospital and acting nobly to Briton and Boer alike; and I take this
opportunity of acknowledging with sincere thanks their careful treatment
and kindness to me during the ten days I was their patient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ruling passions are strong even when one is at death’s door, and I
cannot help recalling a sporting bet I had with my kind friend Sister Alma.
It took the usual shape of a bet with a woman—gloves—and I laid her a
dozen pairs to nothing that the war would be over by Christmas, which
not only I but many high in authority fully believed it would. We were
passing Durban on our way back to India during the second week in
December, and, taking the then situation, I looked upon my bet as lost and
bailed up. One of my subalterns, who was landing there to return to the
seat of war, kindly carried out my commission, and forwarded the gloves
to the winner, from whom I received a prompt acknowledgment, with the
usual remark that women are always right, and I believe they are! At
least, I never attempt to contradict them, and yet I am a bachelor.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden being in hospital, and debarred, therefore, to
his regret, from leading the corps in a march for which it had
already been detailed, Major Chamney took temporary command,
and a few days later received orders to hand over horses and
proceed by train to rejoin the other detachment under Captain
Beresford at Machadodorp. This uneventful stage of the campaign
is thus described by the correspondent of an Indian paper
serving with Lumsden’s Horse:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Prior to this the Imperial Light Horse had left Mahon’s brigade, and
we heard that they too expected to be disbanded shortly. General Mahon
made them a speech before they left, praising them highly for the good
work they had done while with him, and saying how sorry he was to part
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On October 1 we handed over nearly all our horses to the New
Zealanders, keeping only such of them—four or five, if I remember right—as
had been brought from India and come right through the whole show.
Four others also were kept for the doctor’s cart, the horses he had
before being played out. But the experiment did not turn out a success,
as the first time they were put into harness they bolted and there was
a general smash-up. The leaders broke away and vanished into space,
and were never seen by us again; and the wheelers got mixed up in the
traces and upset the cart, damaging it hopelessly in their struggles to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>free. The doctor was thenceforth cartless, I think, and the implements of
his trade had to be carried in one of the Transport carts.</p>

<p class='c000'>After giving over our horses we were marched into town, and camped
close to the station for the night. The Transport, with the heavy
luggage and led horses, were to leave next day by road for Machadodorp,
for which place we too were bound. The rest of the regiment, under
Captain Beresford, had been stationed there for some time. Next morning
we proceeded to the station and loaded our saddle, baggage, and a few
of our small Transport carts into open trucks, into which we ourselves
afterwards scrambled, the train moving off immediately. There was
not overmuch room, but we were not particular, and this did not very
greatly bother us. After proceeding about sixteen miles we had to
get out and walk to Avoca, a railway station about three miles further
on, as, owing to the Boers having smashed up a bridge here, the train
was unable to get across. Waggons were awaiting us, into which we
loaded the baggage, &amp;c., also making use of the Transport carts we had
brought with us.</p>

<p class='c000'>On arriving at Avoca we heard that an accident had occurred further
up the line, and we should not therefore be able to go on till next day. We
camped in the open, and spent a wretched night, as it rained incessantly,
and by daybreak everything was sopping wet. Hearing next morning
that we would not be leaving for some hours, several of us foraged round
and found an empty hut, in which we took shelter, as the rain still continued,
and made ourselves very fairly comfortable. There was any amount of
firewood about, so we were able to semi-dry our blankets, &amp;c. When the
train came in at midday it was found that there was not room for
more than about fifteen of us, besides the saddles, baggage, and Transport
carts.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Kaapmuiden we got on to the main line from Komati Poort to
Pretoria. This junction presented a really woeful sight. The Boers had
evacuated the place in great haste, throwing away stores, &amp;c., galore,
principally large quantities of flour, which had been rendered useless by
sprinkling it with kerosine, making it smell horribly and totally unfitting
it for consumption. Whole trains had been burned as they stood on the
lines, and an idea of the terrible conflagration may be gathered from the
fact that the rails under the wheels were buckled down by the terrific heat.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Captain Taylor, in one of his amusing reminiscences, pays a
tribute to the work done by Infantry soldiers:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Tommy certainly is the most wonderful all-round man, and quite
prepared to do anything he’s asked. A whole company of Infantry being
converted into mounted troops by such an order as ‘A company of ——
Regiment will be Mounted Infantry’ was at one time quite usual, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>were fair troops in a month. One saw him making bridges and diversions
for the same with the old jokes and quaint oaths; or doing butcher,
baker, slaughterer, tailor, bootmaker, farrier, and all the thousand-and-one
things he is taught. But he fairly surprised me at Barberton.</p>

<p class='c000'>There we had suddenly arrived with a division of Cavalry ‘in the
air.’ Within a week we had sent our Cavalry as far as Kaapmuiden—the
point where the Barberton branch line meets the main one from Pretoria to
Komati Poort. Our Infantry had repaired the numerous bridges and
culverts, and we were entrained and taken back to Machadodorp by train.
Every station-master was a junior British officer, the pointsman Tommy,
engine-driver Tommy, who also worked the telegraphs, was stoker,
bridgemaker, platelayer, wheelgreaser, &amp;c. There were a few accidents,
but not many, and a smash was only a joke. No wonder we are hard to
beat.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The trooper correspondent did not look at things quite in that
light, but perhaps he was travelling less luxuriously, and the
humorous side of the situation did not strike him so forcibly:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>It was raining all the time, so things generally were not at all
cheerful, and the prospect of travelling for several hours in open trucks
under these conditions did not help to raise our spirits. However, it
was not so bad after all, as we stretched a huge tarpaulin propped up with
sticks, rifles, and boxes, over the truck we were in, which was piled up to
the top with the baggage, and managed to keep the rain out in this way.
The rest of us were to follow on by the next train. We even managed to
get up a game of whist, and this, with the perusal of such literature as we
had with us and occasional snoozes helped to pass the time. We stayed
that night at Crocodile Poort station, it not being considered safe to travel
after dark. It stopped raining at 10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, so, getting out of the truck, we
built a huge fire and dried our blankets and boiled the inevitable coffee.
We slept in the open, as it was quite fine then; but the dew was so heavy
during the night that everything got sopping wet again by the morning.
We started again at 9, but made very slow progress, as we had long waits
at various stations on the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>From there to Machadodorp is a most interesting and beautiful
country. The line runs between two precipitous ranges quite Swiss in
their magnificence, with a river running between the hills. Then to
Waterval Onder, where the ordinary rails gave place to a cogwheel line
up a steep climb.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left again at 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the following day, and passed through very
fair scenery between that place and the next station, Waterval Boven.
High overhanging kopjes on one side, along the bases of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>line ran, with a deep sort of cañon between, the Crocodile River
flowing along its bottom, and a large square turret-like rock looking
commandingly from the other. In one place the train ran quite close to
the ‘cliff,’ as in the Darjiling Himalayan Railway in India, and almost
under a huge mass of overhanging rocks. There are deep fissures in these
rocks in many places, and they look as if they might get loosened and
overwhelm us at any moment. We were told that in the rains sentries
are posted at this place night and day to give timely warning should
there be any signs of the rocks shifting. The incline, too, is very steep
here, and only a few trucks at a time can be taken up. In our case
eleven trucks were sent up at first, two engines being put on, one in
front and the other behind. To prevent slipping, the hindermost engine
had the usual cog-wheel arrangement working on a centre rail. Shortly
after leaving Waterval Onder you get into a tunnel about a hundred
yards long, I think. It is absolutely unventilated, so it can be imagined
that the smoke from the engines, which, seated as we were in open
trucks, simply poured down our throats and up our noses, very nearly
suffocated us.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stayed at Waterval Boven till 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and then went on to
Machadodorp, where we found the rest of the regiment, which was
encamped there, under Captain Beresford. They had marched to this
place from Belfast, where Lord Roberts inspected them. Here we were
greatly undeceived. Instead of going on down country for home, as we
expected, we received orders to equip, and furthermore to leave the old
brigade we were so fond of under General Mahon, and join General
French’s column in General Dickson’s brigade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men of Lumsden’s Horse arrived in the midst of a very heavy
hailstorm. Like all true soldiers, they were ready to make a jest of
discomfort, and seeing the company commander, whose name happened
to be Jim, as he crawled under the shelter of his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tente d’abri</em></span>, they struck
up the then popular music-hall chorus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O lucky Jim,</div>
      <div class='line'>How I envy him!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden was at this time speculating on the chances
that his corps might soon be ordered home, and in a letter to
Sir Patrick Playfair, written while still in hospital, he says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Ever since we entered Pretoria on June 5 and marched through it to
Irene it has been even betting that the war might end any day or keep
on with this kind of guerilla fighting till Christmas. It looks very like
the latter now. I have discussed the matter frequently, while lying in
my bed here, with Colonel Wools-Sampson, commanding the Imperial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Light Horse, and Colonel Craddock, commanding the Australian contingent,
both in Mahon’s brigade with myself. They fully hold my opinion
that, although this unexpected delay comes harder on the Volunteer
personally than was anticipated when he joined, yet it was all in the
bargain. I also assure the men that Government looks upon the
Colonial Volunteer movement as much too big a factor in this crisis
to be ignored or undervalued, and that not one day beyond what
is actually necessary shall we be kept in harness in this country.
There is no doubt that the complete pacification or subjugation of
this huge Colony is a much bigger question than we soundly tackled
at the start, or were prepared to face. De Wet and Botha are harder
nuts to crack than we imagined. I am extremely proud of and pleased
with the doings of the corps, and I feel sure it has been worthy of its
Honorary Colonel and its many friends and supporters in the land we hail
from. How kind Lord Roberts has been to us and to me personally I
can hardly state here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our good fortune in the way of obtaining commissions in the Regular
forces speaks volumes on this point, besides other civil appointments
already granted, to say nothing, I hope, of others in store when we
disband. As regards the Transvaal Police, which a number of my
men were keen to join when it started in June, I distinctly said, ‘<em>No</em>, until
we are disbanded. If Government would say “Disband,” then I’ll do my
best for you with commissions, &amp;c.; but until then, <em>No</em>.’ The terms were
10<em>s.</em> per diem, horse allowance, and rations. Of course these were tempting
to men playing a hard game on 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> per day, but Government soon
stopped enrolment, the New Zealand Government having declined to let
their Volunteers join. I hear it is being opened again to a small extent,
mostly for mechanics, but these are not the class I’ve got. What they
mean really to do is to make the Transvaal and Orange River Police the
soldiers of the immediate future, and take all the suitable Volunteers they
can to back it up. A right good plan too, and I fancy they are only
waiting for the opportune moment to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>As regards funds, I feel sure we shall end up well. I never lose a
chance of buying little extras for the men in the way of Boer tobacco and
tinned milk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any quantity of the stores for officers went astray, and heaps were
given away to the men, &amp;c. I can truly assure you the officers will not
make much out of the hunt!</p>

<p class='c000'>I don’t know what my movements will be—Calcutta or London,
depending on that of the corps. At one period our orders were the
latter, to be in the Colonial Volunteer Inspection by the Queen, but
I fear it is too late in the day for that to come off, and that it will
now be Calcutta direct for all that remain of us. Well, as you know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>it is hard to beat in the cold season, and always enjoyable to me, so
I don’t mind.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>So ended the experiences of Lumsden’s Horse under Brigadier-General
Mahon’s command. They had been with him two
months in circumstances that try the mettle of men, whether
officers or privates, and their devotion to him had increased day
by day. In camp or in action he was always the same, never
worrying himself or harassing his men. On the contrary, he more
than once gave up his own rough shelter in a deserted house or
hut so that his troops might have firewood for cooking their
scant rations of tough mutton or horseflesh. Their confidence
in him was unbounded because they said he never got them into
a tight place without knowing how to get them out again; and
they would have followed him anywhere. That was the feeling
of all ranks in the brigade for their General. His confidence in
them was equally firm. In a letter which the Editor has
permission to quote, that distinguished leader writes: ‘Lumsden’s
Horse served with me for some months, and a better lot of men
and officers could not be found.’</p>

<p class='c006'>Before presenting as a connected whole the separate descriptions
dealing with a movement which had for its object the disintegration
of Boer forces that still held the high veldt and thus threatened
both railway lines east of Johannesburg, it will be well to summarise
briefly the experience of troopers under Captain Beresford’s
command while separated from the headquarters of their corps.
It will be remembered that when General Mahon set out from
Pretoria to join General French in his dash on Barberton more
than two-thirds of Lumsden’s Horse were left behind waiting for
remounts, with instructions to follow as fast as possible, or as soon
as General Cunningham, under whose orders they were placed
for a time, might permit. What happened then is especially interesting
as evidence of the class of horse that was being issued to
mounted troops at that stage for operations against an exceedingly
mobile enemy. The Boers were then practically nomads, having
no fixed bases from which supplies were drawn, and therefore no
lines of communication to be cut. Pursuit of them was therefore
very much like hunting a fox that has been driven out of
his own familiar country. If he runs the pack ‘out of scent,’
there is nothing to serve as a guide for the casts that may be
made in hope of hitting off the line again, for nobody can say
what the probable ‘point’ is; and unless he can be brought to
hand by a pursuit that never tires and never goes wrong, we may
be sure that there is no chance of running him to ground. Most
of the Boer leaders at that time had their wives and families
with them. Mrs. De la Rey had been living in an ox-waggon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>without fixed abode, since the beginning of war, and accompanying
her husband on every trek from Magersfontein to
Colesberg, and thence in succession to Driefontein, Brandfort,
Kroonstad, the Vaal River, then on to meet Mahon’s column
south of Mafeking, back in haste for the defence of Johannesburg
and Pretoria, from there to Diamond Hill (or Rietfontein as the
Boers call it), then back northward through the bushveldt, and
so to the Magaliesberg Range again. Against an enemy thus
independent of railways or beaten tracks none but well-mounted
troops with horses in the best of condition could hope to achieve
much. For corps in the same plight as Lumsden’s Horse, however,
nothing better could be found than under-bred Argentines or
weedy Hungarians, gross from the combined effects of idleness
and injudicious feeding, and soft from want of exercise, badly
broken, and therefore ill-mannered. One trooper, whose comments
are based on actual experience, as he was among the men to
whom horses were issued for trial, only on the morning of the
day when they marched from Pretoria, writes of the ‘strange
exhibitions’ with this lot of remounts which, to put it mildly,
had not been ridden much before. ‘They were just off the ship,
fat and very soft, and full of beans. One fellow was bucked off,
another dragged, and several very uncomfortable. The horses
had no mouths; they wouldn’t answer to bit, rein, or spur, and it
was impossible to get one away from the rest.’ When the
corps returned from its long trek nearly everybody was in rags,
and very unlike the ‘typical trooper’ of ten months earlier, whose
smart turn-out had been a source of pride to the corps. Clothing,
however, ran short, and many men had difficulty in replacing
their tattered garments by new of any kind.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>However, this detachment, under Captain Beresford, having
cleared up its camp, marched out a day after the corps headquarters
had gone and bivouacked that night ten or twelve
miles east of Pretoria, near the pass known as Donker Hoek.
Colonel Lumsden, having remained behind to see them off, went
on a stage or two by train, hoping that they would overtake the
leading company before it joined General French. The two
detachments were, in fact, though they did not know it, within
cannon sound of each other on September 5, when Mahon had
turned back from Belfast to help the Canadians at Pan station;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>but, after that, every march took them further apart, the Colonel
pushing on with what remained to him of A Company as part of
Mahon’s brigade, while Captain Beresford’s hundred could make
but slow progress on their leg-weary, spiritless horses. The
latter troops, on arrival at Belfast, were inspected by Lord Roberts,
who rode through their lines but made no speech to them.
General Hutton, who was with the Headquarters Staff, cast longing
eyes on Lumsden’s Horse, looked them over, and told Captain
Clifford that he meant to take them on with him. Against such
wholesale appropriation, however, Captain Beresford protested,
saying that the men wanted to join their own corps and the
horses were not fit yet. After appeal to Lord Roberts, Captain
Beresford got his way. While at Belfast the detachment had
unpleasant experience of winter temperature at an altitude of
more than 6,500 feet above sea level. They tried to supply
artificial fuel to the system by additional rations, but were
not very successful, as the resources of Belfast at that time
were low indeed, and certain restrictions had to be placed on
traffic with the Dutch inhabitants, one of whom sold bread from
the eating of which twelve or fourteen men of an Infantry
regiment had been poisoned. So sentries were posted to warn
all soldiers against buying provisions. To keep out the icy wind
some men built themselves little huts of corrugated iron, in the
construction of which we learn that Kingchurch and Cobb and
the brothers Allardice distinguished themselves among one
section of B Company. Captain Beresford came to have a look
at them, and in notes of that time is the appreciative entry:
‘He is a very pleasant man and always polite to every one of us.
He said our tin house was much better than the officers’ tents.
He told us also that Lord Roberts had expressed himself very
much pleased with the appearance of the men and horses.’ At
Belfast also Lumsden’s Horse were visited by their former
comrade Chartres—once a corporal in the corps, ‘who looked
very smart as an Army doctor.’ Their last day at Belfast was
devoted to the mild excitement of watching races, in one of which
Captain Clifford came in about sixth on ‘The Mate,’ and a note
is made of the fact that the Duke of Westminster, who won the
long-distance steeplechase, ‘rode like a workman.’ On the whole,
this brief stay at Belfast was more pleasant than first impressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>of it promised, except for nightly excursions after loose Argentines,
one of which drew his picket peg so persistently and got away
on the open veldt so often that Robertson dubbed him Ulysses
because he was such a wanderer! The next day (November 11)
Captain Beresford’s detachment struck its camp on that breezy
high veldt and marched across the battlefield of Bergendal on its
way to Dalmanutha and Machadodorp as advance guard of
General Cunningham’s brigade. No sooner had it got into
camp once more than B Company was selected to furnish an
escort the next morning for Lord Kitchener. The non-commissioned
officer who was to be in command had no other
uniform than the weather-stained and saddle-worn suit that had
done service throughout most of the campaign. Luckily, however,
one of the Hussars offered to sell sundry things. He was
a Reservist, and knew his way about a military camp. From him
a complete outfit was obtained, and the purchaser then discovered,
much to his amusement, that he had been dealing with one who
was a pushing commercial traveller in private life. So the non-commissioned
officer was able to turn out a credit to the escort.
But some mistake had been made about the rendezvous, which,
however, the escort found at last by the lucky accident of meeting
Major J.K. Watson, Lord Kitchener’s A.D.C. By that time
the General had gone on. ‘So had to follow at a tremendous
pace, galloped up every steep hill and down the other side over
terrible ground, a mass of stones and such clouds of dust that
you could not see the ground or whither you were going. Then
caught up Lord Kitchener, who was riding with General Hamilton
towards a big camp on the top of a hill, where they told us
General Smith-Dorrien was in command. Very soon started
back again. This time Lord Kitchener by himself, and a nice
pace he led us, up hill and down, in clouds of dust. Got back
before 1, having started at 10 and covered twelve miles
altogether.’ During a month at Machadodorp, outpost duty and
patrols towards Lydenburg or Helvetia, where Boers were often
seen but never showed fight except by sniping at long range,
formed the ordinary routine. This, however, was varied by football
matches, for which Lumsden’s Horse furnished a strong team
with Hickley in goal, Kirwan and Winder as backs, Courtenay,
Brown, and G. Lawrie halves, Robertson, Luard, Holme, Tancred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>and Lloyd-Jones forwards. Unfortunately, Robertson injured
his knee in one of these matches and had to go into hospital.
It was at Machadodorp that Sergeant Stephens, of the Indian
Commissariat, who was attached to the Transport Staff of
Lumsden’s Horse, distinguished himself by several solitary expeditions
into the unexplored country round about. From one
of these he came back with a pom-pom carriage which he had
found at a farm and several ‘poor orphans,’ as he described pigs
whose owners had deserted them. Once, however, he got
caught himself, as narrated in Captain Taylor’s private collection
of reminiscences:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div id='i346'  class='figleft id015'>
<img src='images/i_b_346.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>SERGEANT STEPHENS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We had an Indian Transport sergeant lent to us, and a very good
useful man he was; but he always had a desire to kill a Boer with his
own hand and to be able to swear to it. One day
when he was out getting supplies he saw an armed
Boer riding over an adjacent ridge, so he left his
carts and cantered away to cut him off. On
nearing the ridge he slipped off his horse and
proceeded on foot. Topping the ridge, he saw the
Boer coming towards him and had him dead
practically. Suddenly something touched him.
Looking up, he saw three rifle muzzles, and he
was a prisoner with a party of Boers. They took
his rifle and horse and told him to come along
with them. He walked between them for a
bit, and, being a very amusing Irishman, proceeded
to explain that in his opinion it wasn’t entertaining him like a guest to
make him tramp while they rode. They treated the subject at first as
a joke, but he was so persistent that they at last grew angry, and
threatened to shoot him if he didn’t be quiet. On this point also he was
found to be so argumentative that at last in despair they told him to
make himself scarce, which he did with alacrity, arriving in camp by
evening none the worse for his adventure, and quite pleased, as he had
only suffered to the extent of a walk, a Government rifle, and a comparatively
useless pony.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Lord Roberts remained at Machadodorp, B Company
was often called upon to furnish an escort of the smartest
men, and for this duty Cobb, Kingchurch, David and Hugh
Allardice, Ian Sinclair, Robertson, and Biscoe, or at least
two or three of them, were generally selected. But the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>for more active service had come again, and with the return of
A Company from Barberton to Machadodorp Captain Beresford’s
command ceased to have an independent existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on October 6 that Major Chamney’s force marched
into camp without horses, and on the following day Colonel
Lumsden passed through Machadodorp in the Princess Christian’s
hospital train bound for Pretoria. Having received a sufficient
number of remounts from among horses that had been left behind
by the Imperial Light Horse and 18th Hussars, the corps was
ready to take its place in General Dickson’s brigade for the
sweeping movement by which it was hoped that General French
would clear the country between De Kaap Mountains and
Pretoria. Nobody at the time thought that it would be rather
more like a rearguard action, continued from day to day, than a
triumphal progress. We know that from morning to night the
Boers followed every movement of French’s columns, potting at
them almost incessantly. No matter at what hour the British
troops began their march or halted in bivouac, or how often they
changed direction, the enemy was always with them, and always
close enough to see, though not often seen. A more harassing
march has probably never been endured by any force of similar
strength in that country. All these things we know, but men
kept for the privacy of their own diaries a record of the physical
sufferings that came to them through hunger and thirst where
food, if not scarce, could seldom be cooked because of the thunderstorms
night after night and the absence of firewood. Notwithstanding
all these discomforts, we find a cheery strain running
through the unprinted records of Lumsden’s Horse, and quite a
joyful note when by chance the means of making a fire falls in their
way. Then somebody is sure to be provided with meat to cook,
and we are told how Kingchurch unexpectedly produced ‘chops
done to a turn,’ or Cobb’s stew ‘was a triumph,’ or how ‘the indefatigable
Hugh cooked chops while it still rained, and after dark
he cooked mutton for to-morrow.’ The chronicler, in his gratitude,
says: ‘Such men deserve to be remembered, and to have
their honoured names handed down to posterity,’ and so they find
a place in this History. One night, when rain was being driven
in sheets by a howling wind across the bare hillside, some of
Lumsden’s Horse could find no better shelter than an ant-heap,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>round the lee side of which they grouped themselves, huddling
together for warmth. Kingchurch, finding them there, said in
his whimsical way that they had selected the ‘most epithetally
uncomfortable ant-heap in all South Africa.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is almost impossible to follow consecutively the movements
of General French’s columns, which consisted of a nominal
brigade under General Mahon (the 8th and 14th Hussars and
M Battery R.H.A.), a second under General Gordon (7th Dragoon
Guards, Scots Greys, and guns), and a third, which included
Lumsden’s Horse, a half-battalion Suffolk Regiment, O Battery
R.H.A., and pom-pom section, under General Dickson. Two
Cavalry regiments, the Scots Greys and Carabiniers, with a
battery of Artillery, were kept under General French’s personal
direction on at least one occasion, and used by him with great
effect when by marching out of Bethel he induced the Boers to
come in, and then pounced on them. This, however, is general
history. The operations in which Lumsden’s Horse took part are
described by several correspondents in the following narrative:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At the beginning the original idea was to move on a wide front
through Carolina, Ermelo, Bethel to Heidelberg, and in consequence we
started in the afternoon of October 11 with Dickson’s brigade in the
centre, its main duty being to escort and protect the reserve convoys
of all three columns, Mahon being eight to nine miles off on our right and
Gordon a similar distance on our left, these two columns taking with them
only necessary supplies for a few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>The very first day Mahon got a severe check, losing some five officers
and fifty men, while the next day Gordon on the left was in turn hotly
engaged. After this General French deemed it politic to bring in the
flank columns closer, and thenceforth we proceeded with only half our
former front, thus rendering mutual assistance more easy. Although
the division consisted of three brigades, so called, Mahon’s was only
about 500 strong, Gordon’s 600, and Dickson’s 700, amounting in all to
only three regiments on full strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our task was an extremely arduous and difficult one, for the first few
marches were through hilly country, and the convoy advancing in a single
string covered seven miles. To protect it from surprise we had but 400
mounted troops, the Infantry being kept more or less concentrated near
the waggons. You can imagine, therefore, that our sphere of operations
was a very extended one, much being evidently left to the initiative of
individuals, as personal control by officers was well-nigh impossible. This
was the kind of fighting that brought into prominence the good points of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Irregular troops, of which every man is used to act on his own responsibility
as occasion demands, wherein he differs from the trained soldier, who
is educated to act on orders only. The nature of the convoy added greatly
to the fatigue men had to endure. Oxen formed part of the convoy and, as
they are unable apparently at this season of the year to march except in the
cool of the morning and evening, the working day comprised twenty-four
hours. The usual marching hour for ‘ox’ was 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, necessitating <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>réveille</em></span>
at 2.15 often in the rain, the ‘mule’ following an hour later. The convoy
commenced packing at 8 o’clock, and a halt was observed till 2 or 3 in the
afternoon. In the afternoon ‘mule’ led off, the ‘ox’ following. By this
arrangement the ‘ox’ avoided all heat, but never got into camp till 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
or thereabouts. Mounted troops had far the worst of this, for while the
Infantry could put in a long sleep and have a good meal, the mounted
troops, broken up into small parties, were posted on hills all round, and
the need to keep a sharp look-out left them few opportunities for sleeping
or getting meals. This bit of country was particularly hard on the men,
as it was with the greatest difficulty that one could obtain firewood and
water by day; and as we often arrived in camp long after dark, it was
still more difficult to get an evening camp fire. To add to the trials, half
of the available men were on picket over night, and during the day we
were surprised incessantly. Our picket duties brought us into constant
little engagements in which the corps had the opportunity of acting on
its own, and, being ably handled by Major Chamney, quite distinguished
itself in a small way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>When General Dickson’s brigade, or rather huge convoy, to which
we were attached as the only mounted troops, began its march <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span>
for Carolina, the Brigadier’s method was to make an early start, halt
at 10 or 11 o’clock for three or four hours, and then make easy progress
on to camp for the day. The veldt was changing into its spring coat
of green, so that the cattle could graze during halts; in consequence, their
condition was not so bad. On the morning of the 12th the camp was
aroused by the sound of big guns booming to our right front, and though
the brigade was booked to start at 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> it was not till 7.30 that the
convoy got on the way. Later in the day the news was heliographed
that the Boers had made a determined attack on General Mahon’s camp,
had driven in the outposts, and had only been beaten back after severe
fighting, Mahon’s casualties being as high as fifty. On the 13th the
music of big guns was again heard at dawn, but to our left front, and the
news came through that the Boers had attacked Gordon, but this time
received a reception they were totally unprepared for, while Dickson with
the convoy had camped by 1.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> outside Carolina. As Carolina had
been in Boer occupation since the time General Mahon touched there
on his way to Barberton, every precaution was taken against any surprise.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Rumour said the Boers had sworn to trap French or take the convoy, and
therefore our escort was augmented by the 7th Dragoon Guards, Scots
Greys, and O Battery R.H.A. Our experience for the second time of
Carolina was a bitter one; not only was the weather intensely cold, but the
whole regiment was sent out on outlying picket for twenty-four hours.
On the 15th a five-mile march was made, but on the 16th at 2.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>réveille</em></span> was whistled, and at 3.45 Lumsden’s had started at a gallop as
advance guard, a dense fog prevailing. A midday halt of three hours
was made at Krantzpan, but camp was pitched at Klipsteple after dark.
Klipsteple is the highest point in the Transvaal, and a huge smooth-faced
boulder stands on the highway.
On this boulder visitors have
engraved their names, so that it is
almost covered with letters and
dates, though the names, so familiar
to all, of the leaders of the Boer
cause are conspicuously absent. On
the 17th we formed the rearguard,
and were engaged in destroying a
farm when a party of about 200
Boers reconnoitred our vicinity.
We looked at one another, and
they evidently decided against a
fight, for Mahon had that morning
beaten this same lot rather badly.
They retired on Carolina, and we
proceeded onward to camp. From
this point our further progress was
slow, as the Boers hugged the
flanks and persistently attacked the
rearguard. It was a new light to
view the enemy in, and it came somewhat
as a surprise. Hitherto the Boer had adopted the running game.
It was very gratifying to hear that the enemy possessed neither guns nor
big-gun ammunition. On the 18th A Company were doing advance guard,
supported by B Company, when they suddenly encountered the fire of
thirty Boers strongly entrenched at point-blank range. They fell back,
and No. 4 Section, B Company, advanced and, opening volley fire under
Captain Sidey’s orders, soon cleared the front, while O Battery sent shell
after shell into the fleeing horsemen. Captain Kenna—well known in
India—Dickson’s Brigade Major, was good enough to speak favourably of
us. It was the first ‘scrap’ we had had under his leadership. During the
cannonade a funny incident occurred. A rifle and bandolier were found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>in a farm where only women were to be seen. As this meant burning
the farm and seizing all stock, the Boer’s wife, riding on a man’s saddle,
sought out the General, who chivalrously acceded to her request, and
the burning was countermanded. The next day passed quietly as far as
we were concerned, though Mahon’s guns could be heard in rear from
time to time. Hitherto the enemy had employed guns, but to-day the
welcome intelligence was passed along that they were completely out of
gun ammunition. The camp was pitched at Bethel, a town containing only
some six families, three of them English. On the 20th (morning) the
regiment paraded for inspection by General French, who took advantage
of the day’s halt at Bethel to say a few words of encouragement to each
regiment. Addressing Lumsden’s Horse, he said ‘that the reputation of
the corps stood very high; their behaviour and gallantry were spoken of by
everyone, and, though he had no personal knowledge of the corps, he had
heard of their splendid work and the good service they had done. There
was no doubt that everyone of all ranks was anxious for a rest, which
was well deserved. There was no saying, however, what might happen,
but he hoped the onward march to Heidelberg would be an easy one, and
he trusted to Lumsden’s Horse maintaining to the end that reputation
for gallantry they had worthily earned.’ At the conclusion of the
address, Major Chamney called for three cheers for General French. As
the Boers were hovering all round us, the entire regiment spent the
night on outlying picket; and it was a night!—wet, cold, and miserable.
At 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 22nd the brigade stood to arms, and by 4.30 Bethel had
been left behind. The Boers were most persistent, and tenaciously hung
round us, losing no opportunity of sniping. About 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we were caught
in a terrific hailstorm, the hail lying an inch thick upon the veldt, when
it ceased, leaving us shivering and drenched, though cheerful enough
as we resumed our onward course at the gallop to restore circulation
in men and horses. Before camping we did some distant shooting at
the enemy, but gave it up as too long a range. The water at this camp
was inky black, but in the absence of better had to be used for tea and
coffee, though many decided to defer a wash till next day. The whole
regiment were again put on duty as pickets, and in their exposed positions
had a bitter experience of a typical South African hailstorm during
that afternoon. The next day the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>réveille</em></span> whistle sounded at 2.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>,
and the different brigades were on the move by 4.15. The enemy kept
up sniping systematically on the flanks, while the guns in rear were in
action some half-a-dozen times during the day. During the afternoon a
terrific hailstorm burst over us, saturating our garments and making
everybody very miserable. The hail lay inches deep on the veldt.
Prisoners were taken daily, and a few refugee women were under our protection.
A singular incident occurred on this day. One of the prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>who had surrendered handed in a Lee-Metford rifle belonging to Lumsden’s
Horse, which has since been identified as belonging to Corporal
Macgillivray, of A Company, who had been taken prisoner at Ospruit,
our first fight. The 25th, however, was a great day. No. 4 Section
B Company was rearguard left flank, the 7th Dragoon Guards in the
centre-rear, and A Company right flank. Immediately we had taken up
positions the Boers pressed home an attack on the left, and No. 3
Section B Company, acting as support, was engaged. The Carabiniers
had retired some ten minutes when the left flankers rose from cover and
moved towards their led horses. As they mounted, the Boers reached a
ridge commanding our position and
within range; they peppered us very
smartly as we galloped out of range
without a single casualty. In the
meantime O Battery had come into
action, doing excellent practice.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Hana, Ltd.</em></span><br />D. MORISON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Startled by the firing, Captain
Clifford’s horse took fright, and,
galloping away, was lost in the distance,
Clifford being then on foot
controlling the firing. ‘General’
Parks gallantly offered to ride out
and catch the beast, and was allowed
to do so. He quickly vanished from
sight, and nobody knew whither
he had gone. As the convoy had
moved on, orders came for the
rearguard to do likewise, and our
corps, together with the 7th Dragoon
Guards, retired in extended line to
the next ridge, an observation post,
to endeavour to show Parks the
way in. As there was no sign of him for a considerable time, Captain
Taylor, the Adjutant, who had been indefatigable all the morning,
exposing himself to encourage us while we were in a really tight corner,
took out a subsection and scoured the country round searching for
Parks, but without success. The sections (Nos. 4 and 2 of B Company)
had to move on, but Corporal Graves and Troopers Morison, Maxwell,
and Betts, on their own responsibility and in a Quixotic spirit
of chivalry, resolving not to abandon Parks, stayed behind to assist him.
There was danger in that decision, as it exposed those men to the risk
of getting mixed up with, or, at any rate, mistaken, for the enemy.
Captain Sidey noticed their absence, and, being certain they were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>danger from our own guns, sent Trooper Behan to order the adventurous
troopers back. In a sporting spirit, however, the men who had
made up their minds to see Parks through refused to come in and
remained on the observation post. Shortly after, another messenger was
sent, with threats of instant arrest if orders were not obeyed. Just as
this man arrived, Parks was seen through a glass leading the Captain’s
horse about two miles away to the left rear and close to the flanks of the
former position from which the Boers had been firing. He was making a
very bad line to rejoin us, so Morison offered to gallop down and endeavour
to show him the way, despite the half-company officer’s orders. This
he did and succeeded in bringing in Parks, but directly our small
party, retiring, crowned the rise, O Battery, from a distance of 4,600
yards, being informed that we were most certainly Boers, plumped a
shell into the middle of us, the wind of the shell knocking off Graves’s
hat and bursting a horse’s length behind the party, and, needless to
say, we galloped in for all we were worth. Luckily for us, the gunner
was informed who we were before sending a second shot along. He
remarked, however, that he thought it was a jolly good shot.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Captain Taylor gives a slightly different version of the
incident:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We were acting as rearguard to Dickson’s column, when Captain
Clifford’s horse took fright and ran away while his master was dismounted.
One of our sailors, Parks, went after it, and
followed it for two miles at right angles to our
line of advance. We saw him catch the horse
and begin leading it back, and then saw him no
more, though we waited half an hour. As messages
were coming from the rearguard commander
to us to follow more quickly, we had to leave, all
fully convinced that our poor Parks had been
ambushed.</p>

<div id='i355'  class='figright id016'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>CORPORAL J. GRAVES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After a mile or so, our widely extended line
came down a long, fairly steep incline, on the top
of the opposite slope of which we saw our Battery
O in position. As we neared the bottom of the
intervening valley the battery opened fire with one round, which burst
on the top of the slope we had just left, and looking round we saw a
party of six men riding down at a gallop, waving a handkerchief. They
turned out to be some of our own men, who, having at the last moment
seen Parks coming in, waited for him. The battery had seen the
heads of mounted men in slouch hats advance quickly, and, mistaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>them for Boers following us, had ‘laid’ for them. The shot was
such a good one that it knocked off the hat of Sergeant Graves, and the
Adjutant’s office went near to losing its clerk, and the Bank of Bengal
one of its rising staff.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Another correspondent continues the narrative:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the 26th the united brigades reached Heidelberg by sundown,
but sustained two casualties in the rearguard. The safe escort of the
convoy is locally reported as a creditable performance, and there were no
fewer than 150 casualties in the united brigades since leaving Machadodorp.
It was a very trying march, as rain fell nearly every day in torrents.
Sleep was out of the question in deep pools of water, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>réveille</em></span> daily at
2.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> gave us little rest. We had taken 109 prisoners and brought on
some twenty refugee families. Heidelberg is the prettiest town we have
yet seen in the Transvaal, nestling as it does at the base of a rugged kopje
in a perfect tope of eucalyptus, willow, peach, and oak trees. The majority
of the houses are above the ordinary type—flowers abound in the gardens,
and the surrounding veldt has donned its spring coat of green; the fruit
trees are loaded with fruit, which in another month should sweeten our
rations of dry biscuits. But—there is a ‘but’—the stores are absolutely
barren. Foodstuffs and provisions of every kind are badly needed
by the residents themselves. A Wesleyan clergyman informed the writer
that he hadn’t tasted meat for a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roses abounded in the gardens attached to the picturesque villas, and
altogether a feeling of peace and security seemed to prevail. Our stay
was a limited one, and on the 30th (morning) the trek was resumed through
Nigel to Springs. The country we had to traverse is rich in mineral
wealth, gold and coal mines being already in existence, while hundreds of
claims are pegged out against the setting-in of peace and the advance of
the capitalist. At Springs, on the return journey to Pretoria, we were
saluted by Colt guns, which were repeatedly fired at us as we approached
the trenches, manned by British troops. Our men were naturally very irate,
and wanted very much to fire back. They considered it particularly hard
lines, since we had been marching in the open and heliographing from a
distance of ten miles. The 31st was a great day, as a parade before His
Excellency Lord Roberts was fixed for 10.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> The Commander-in-Chief
was punctual to time, and during the inspection addressed himself
to the several companies as he met them. The various regiments then
went past in order of brigades and returned to camp. Major Chamney,
before dismissing Lumsden’s Horse, paraphrased what Lord Roberts had
said to him for the benefit of the regiment. Briefly, it was to the effect
that the disbandment of the corps was at the present time impossible,
but Lord Roberts had telegraphed to His Excellency the Viceroy asking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>him to use his influence in keeping appointments open as far as
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse had requested disbandment on the reasonable
grounds of pressing business in India, and the fact of local Colonial and
other Volunteer corps—notably the C.I.V., Loch’s Horse, and others—having
been disintegrated. At first an abrupt refusal was given, but
yesterday General French telegraphed to Lord Kitchener and strongly
recommended our case. A reply has been received that only those
having business of an urgent nature in India may return, but they must
pay their own expenses back, only a railway ticket to port of embarkation
being provided. Needless to say, many are going even on these conditions,
but those who desire to go to England have to hang on for an indefinite
period of time still. Only from Machadodorp three Surma Valley men
were allowed to leave, as their appointments were in jeopardy. These
men had free passages back given them. Again, a fortunate few have
been given employment in South Africa, and they were permitted to leave
as their appointments were secured. These number altogether about
twenty. Colonel Lumsden is unfortunately still away from the regiment,
sick at Pretoria. Major Chamney, officiating in command, finds his hands
tied to some extent, and cannot do much for us in matters of such moment.
But the feeling in the regiment is very strong, and the term ‘Volunteer’
is sneered at as a misnomer. If the war was not over it would be quite
another matter; but it has been announced that the war is practically ended,
and the duties now to be performed are in the nature of police work.</p>

<p class='c000'>All round Springs was a hotbed of Boers, and patrols proceeding two
or three miles from camp were invariably sniped at. Just outside Springs
we had great luck in finding a brewery which, despite the war, had not
ceased to brew, and we regaled ourselves with limited quantities of Colonial
stout in a vain endeavour to keep out the eternal rain. The Boers, who
were used to dealing with a garrison armed with carbines, were rather
surprised one day when going to round up some cattle they ran into a
small patrol of our corps, and Trooper Consterdine fetched one of them
out of the saddle with a good shot at 1,800 yards, and thus gave them a
lesson which will probably make them more careful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weather now became absolutely vile. There were hailstorms
every afternoon, just late enough to spoil any chance of getting dry for the
night. The roads were very heavy, and horses could not get on. We
hoped and concluded the Boers were in the same fix. From Springs
the Boers ceased to give trouble, but this was more than atoned for by
the abominable weather and going. For forty-eight hours it poured
torrents without ceasing, and there was not a dry skin or blanket in the
division. To remove misapprehension, it is necessary to say men had
seen no tents for practically eight months. Bad it was for us and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the horses, but worse for the Transport, the animals dying daily to
such an extent that it was all they could do to drag empty waggons
into Pretoria. Pistol-shots every morning latterly had announced the
death of animals that had dragged our carts for many miles, and to save
the waggons from falling into the hands of the Boers there was nothing
to do but burn them. It was no uncommon sight to see cattle lying in
the last stages of exhaustion on the road, and ere death ensued being cut
up and looked upon as a great treat by the local Kaffirs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody was struck by the formation of our Transport when out of
hilly country; the waggons moved along in a dense mass with a frontage
of about a quarter of a mile and depth of half a mile, the whole mass
forcing its way over nullahs and obstacles irresistibly. It will be obvious
to all that this formation of the convoy lent itself much more easily to
protection than a stream of waggons seven miles long.</p>

<p class='c000'>At 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> of November 1 the trek was resumed, the direction being
Pretoria. A heavy drizzle of rain was falling, and without intermission
it continued for three days, only ceasing when Pretoria was seen in the
distance on the morning of the 3rd. Every garment, whether on the
person or in the kit bags, was wet, and never was sunshine more welcome
than on that morning. By 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the regiment had camped on the far
side of the racecourse, and for the first time since April experienced the
shelter of tents.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Though they did not know it at the time, Lumsden’s Horse as a
corps had done their last march in the Transvaal, and fired their
last shot against the Boers. They had begun to think that others,
with less chance of serving the Empire elsewhere and fewer
interests calling them home, could very well do all the work that
remained to be done in South Africa. Yet up to that time their
expressions of a wish to be relieved, as other Volunteer contingents
had been, from the fruitless pursuit of guerilla raiders,
was productive of no result. It is hardly surprising, therefore,
after the miserable experiences of a sweeping movement, by which
nothing of any importance had been achieved, and from which
nobody suffered much except the troops engaged in it, that a
spirit of discontent should have begun to manifest itself among
men who knew that every day they remained in South Africa
might jeopardise all their future careers. They were running
the risk of losing all and gaining no commensurate advantage
either for themselves or for the Empire. It is little to be
wondered at, therefore, that they should have envied the City
Imperial Volunteers, the Canadians, and some other Colonial
contingents which had been allowed to leave for home when
Lord Roberts declared that regular warfare was at an end. Even
the departure of some of their own comrades, whose plea of urgent
private affairs had prevailed over military considerations, seemed
to some extent a grievance, so that when Thesiger, Townsend-Smith,
and Moir-Byres were allowed to go many others regretted
that they also had not applied for passages to India instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>England. So far back as October 9, Army Orders had contained
the following:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Colonial Contingents</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>It has been brought to the notice of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief
that many men of the Colonial contingents made arrangements
before leaving their homes for only one year, which has now nearly
expired. Though precise date cannot yet be fixed on which all will be
free, commanding officers may submit names of any urgent cases at
once, and the Field-Marshal hopes that within the next few weeks he
may be able to dispense with their services, which have proved invaluable
to the Empire.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>But Lord Roberts, with every wish to meet the convenience
of those who had sacrificed much for the sake of serving under
him, found himself hampered by unforeseen circumstances, which
were fully explained in one of his despatches about this date.
‘There still remained much for the Army in South Africa to do
before the country could be said to be completely conquered.
Certain Boer leaders, notably De Wet and De la Rey, had still to
be dealt with, and the guerilla warfare carried on by them put
a stop to.’ This state of affairs made it imperative that the
Army should be broken up into several comparatively small
columns of increased mobility. Mounted troops were therefore
in more demand than ever.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Great difficulty was experienced in carrying out these necessary
changes owing to the time having arrived for the withdrawal of the
Royal Canadian Dragoons, the Royal Canadian Regiment, the three
batteries of Canadian Artillery, and the greater part of the first contingents
furnished by Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, and
allowing the members of the second South African corps to return to their
homes and employments after having been embodied for twelve months.
It was impossible to disregard the urgent reasons given by our Colonial
comrades for not being able to remain longer at the seat of war. They
had done admirable service and shown themselves well fitted to take
their places by the side of Her Majesty’s Regular troops, and I witnessed
their departure with deep regret, not only on account of their many
soldierly qualities, but because it materially impaired the mobility and
efficiency of the Army in South Africa for the time being, a very critical
time, too, until indeed a fresh body of Mounted Infantry could be formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>from the nearest available Line battalions, and the several South African
local corps could be again recruited up to their original strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the Commander-in-Chief, having declared that regular
warfare was at an end, found himself unable to deal effectually
with raiding guerilla bands for want of enough mobile troops.
In this difficulty he kept faith with those who had completed the
year of service for which they had enlisted by letting them go.
Lumsden’s Horse did not come within that category, and, though
Lord Roberts recognised the justice of their Colonel’s plea on
behalf of men who were sacrificing much, he would promise
nothing until fresh companies of Mounted Infantry could be
formed to fill the places left vacant by Canadians, New Zealanders,
and Australians who had gone. Colonel Lumsden’s
ceaseless efforts, however, had so impressed the Commander-in-Chief
that he sent a cable message to the Viceroy urging him,
as Honorary Colonel of Lumsden’s Horse, to use all his influence
with employers on behalf of members of the corps, so that their
appointments in India might be kept open for them a little
longer. Lord Roberts added: ‘I trust the war is nearly over,
but it is essential that all shall hold together till the end, and
it would be a hardship to members of a corps that has done
such gallant service if they were to suffer for their devotion to
the cause of the Empire.’ Several men whose cases were
exceptionally urgent got permission to leave for India, and
others who had accepted commissions in Regular regiments or
civil appointments were necessarily taken off the strength of
the corps, which consequently became reduced to little more
than a full company. One of the Colonel’s Staff, therefore,
thought it an opportune time to trace the whereabouts of men
who had ceased to serve in the ranks of Lumsden’s Horse.
He therefore prepared a record in tabulated form, which was
at that time the most complete return available, though he
prefaced it with an apology for incompleteness:</p>

<p class='c000'>The corps has shifted about such a lot recently that it is difficult to
know accurately what has happened to many men who were left sick at
various points in the march. But the following is pretty correct so far
as it goes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the above-named, Elliott, Burn-Murdoch, and C.A. Walton were
invalided on account of wounds. J.S. Saunders cracked a bone in his
arm when he took the fall at Spytfontein which cost him his liberty, and
he has been sent home by the medical authorities as being incapacitated
for further service. C.E. Stuart is also unfit for active service, as the
wound in his foot sustained at the taking of Pretoria has left permanent
effects. He moves about gingerly, and is buoyed up with the hope of a
pension for life. Stuart wears spectacles, and he’ll need ’em badly when
it comes to drawing his quarterly allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Maclaine, who died here of pneumonia on August 29, makes the
eighth death in the regiment. Though most of us are enjoying splendid
health and spirits, it is sad to reflect that to so many our campaign in
South Africa has brought but sickness and broken constitutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some record of those old comrades whose services have won well-merited
recognition, and whose subsequent movements I have endeavoured
to trace for the delectation of cousins, aunts, creditors, and insurance
company secretaries, would not come amiss. The home authorities and
Lord Roberts himself have treated the regiment most generously in the
matter of commissions in the Regular Army, as the following list will
show. Men named have been gazetted, as far as I can remember, to the
regiments stated below:</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the above, Macdonald’s, I think, has not yet been confirmed, but
all the others have gone, some to their regiments in the country, and
others to report at the War Office. Arathoon, who has been one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>the best and cheeriest of the regiment, is, I am sorry to say, in the Irish
Hospital here recovering from a bad go of rheumatic fever, which will
prevent him from joining his new regiment for a long time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile it appears that Colonel Lumsden had been trying
to secure for Calcutta one of the guns so gallantly captured by
his men. He received the following letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c019'>Army Headquarters, Johannesburg: November 8, 1900.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dear Colonel Lumsden</span>,—With reference to your request to be
permitted to take back to Calcutta one of the guns captured from the enemy,
the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief desires me to inform you that
he fears you must wait until he knows definitely what guns he has to
dispose of.</p>

<div class='c021'>Believe me, yours sincerely,</div>
<div class='c019'><span class='sc'>H.V. Cowan</span>, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Secretary.</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>That the corps were not so homesick as to have lost their
zest for sport or for the simple pleasures that came in their way
may be gathered from the following note furnished by their late
Adjutant:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the conclusion of the march from Machadodorp we were left to
re-equip for ten days at Pretoria, and were one day asked to produce an
officers’ polo team. We had some seven officers to choose from, and a
few chargers which were small enough for the game; no sticks, and
only parade saddles, and we had never played together. However, we
produced a team and went to the fray. We found it was quite a big
affair. There was a crowd of spectators, with a fair ground, umpires,
whistles, &amp;c., and we agreed to play ‘Hurlingham Rules,’ which none of us
knew. They kindly lent us polo-sticks of sorts, and the game began. It
was a really good game, and the chargers, rendered docile by work and
starvation, played wonderfully. However, we were beaten by two goals
to one, and in the return match we each got one goal. We were quite
proud of the show, as our opponents represented the whole garrison,
including one Cavalry division, and were in some practice.</p>

    <div>GAZETTED TO THE REGULAR ARMY</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>One day about this time the Editor was present at a little
scene which may be interesting as an example of the many
strange meetings that characterised a campaign in which men
from all parts of the world came together. His son, a lieutenant
in the Army Service Corps, had just been transferred from an
Irregular Cavalry regiment, and they were celebrating the first
occasion of being together since the relief of Ladysmith. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>another table Colonel Lumsden and some of his officers were
dining. Introductions followed, when suddenly Captain Holmes
and the young lieutenant greeted each other by familiar nicknames
which neither had heard for some years. As students
they had served together in the Artists’ Volunteers, of which
Lord Leighton was then Honorary Colonel. They had been
fighting through the campaign, one from Natal, the other from
Bloemfontein. Their paths had crossed several times without
either knowing it, and here at the end they met in Pretoria
for the first time since boyhood. Such incidents occurred frequently
until they ceased to be strange, and they illustrate the
all-prevailing power of a sentiment that drew men from every
quarter of the globe to South Africa, where the Empire’s interests
centred. All were then beginning to think that there might be
still a long spell of campaigning before them, and, in spite of a
little natural grumbling, they took the prospect philosophically
enough, as we may see by the following extract from a trooper’s
letter:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At Pretoria we were joined by Captain Noblett and Captain
Stevenson, who had been away on two months’ sick leave visiting
Natal battlefields, and Lieutenant Neville, who had left us sick in June,
been to England, and come back, and little expected to find any of us
still there. We were overjoyed to hear we were to have ten days’ rest
in tents, the first we had seen for many months. We were now living
on the fat of the land, with—luxury of luxuries—a dry canteen where you
could buy at half price those necessaries of life which had lately been
considered luxuries, the balance being paid out of the funds provided
by our kind friends in India. Here we waxed fat. Colonel Lumsden,
in his absence from the corps, had not been idle, and had been putting
before the highest authorities the real urgency in many cases to men for
whom prolonged absence from India would mean absolute ruin. To
such purpose did he work that a week after arrival we received the
welcome news that seventy of the most urgent cases were permitted to
go. We saw them off on November 15 under Major Chamney, and
then returned to camp in full anticipation of another year of it. A week
after this came the joyful news that the whole corps was also to return
at once, and on the 22nd we entrained for Cape Town. Despite various
alarms, railway accidents, and breaking up of the line in front of us, we
arrived in Cape Town without mishap.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Alas! for the horses. Only four remained to come back with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>the corps. Some troopers hoped to have brought the regimental
dog, who was quite a veteran and by distinguished service fully
entitled to ease, with a pension for life. Trooper D. Morison
gives the following sketch of him:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>He first attached himself to the regiment at Irene in July 1900. He
very soon became a popular character among us, and went by the name
of Kruger, and from that time on he was always to be found with the
regiment. His intelligence was almost human, and it is a mystery how
he could always find the regiment when marching with other troops.
On more than one occasion he has been the means of finding men in
distant parts of the field owing to his white colour. That dog and
Trooper Burgess seemed to understand each other perfectly. He started
from Pretoria with the regiment <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> for India, but unfortunately got
left behind one morning at a wayside station.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>On November 21 Lord Roberts telegraphed to Colonel Adye,
A.A.G. for Colonial Forces:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Please convey the following message to Colonel Lumsden. Am
extremely sorry to be unable to see Colonel Lumsden’s regiment and say
good-bye before they leave South Africa. I am telegraphing to the
Viceroy, who is Honorary Colonel of the regiment, to express my appreciation
of the admirable work done by all ranks during the present war.
Colonel Lumsden and all serving under him have my best wishes for
their future success.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant-Colonel Lumsden replied:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Kindly convey to Field-Marshal Lord Roberts the deep appreciation
felt by my regiment and myself of the great kindness expressed in his
telegram and shown to us throughout the period we have had the honour
of serving under him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>That telegram was not known in Cape Town when, on
November 22, Major Chamney, with the convalescents and those
who had been allowed to leave the corps a week earlier, marched
to the Docks, headed by the band of the Cheshire Regiment, and
embarked for India on board the ‘Catalonia.’ They went off
amid loud cheers from ship and shore, little thinking that the
corps would so soon follow or that its departure would be
marked by a great demonstration complimentary to every man
in its ranks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sixteen of the corps embarked, under Major Chamney’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>command, in the ‘Catalonia,’ and sailed from Table Bay in the
company of 600 Boer prisoners. At Durban, finding measles
on board the ‘Catalonia,’ they disembarked, and took the Clan
steamer ‘Sinclair’ to Calcutta, calling at Galle by the way.
They were Sergeants Stewart, Pratt, and Oakley; Corporal
Horne, Lance-Corporal Phillips, Troopers Dalton, Clarke, Elsie,
Biscoe, H. Allardice, Elwes, Hight, Lucas, Moore, Brown, and
H.C. Wood. The last named was seized with measles and had
to be left at Galle.</p>

<p class='c000'>On November 23 Field-Marshal Lord Roberts telegraphed
to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Lord Curzon of
Kedleston) as follows:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse left Pretoria to-day for India, about 120 strong.
I cannot allow the corps to leave South Africa without expressing to
your Excellency, as their Honorary Colonel, my appreciation of the
excellent services rendered throughout the war by officers, non-commissioned
officers, and men. Many of them have received commissions in
the Regular forces, and many are remaining in South Africa in various
employments, to take their part in the settlement of that country which
they have assisted to add to Her Majesty’s dominions. It has been a
pride and a pleasure to me to have under my command a Volunteer
contingent which has so well upheld the honour of the Indian Empire.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Viceroy, on November 26, replied:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>It is a great satisfaction to me, as Honorary Colonel of Lumsden’s
Horse, to receive the message in which you have testified to their
gallantry and services in the war. India will welcome those who are
coming back with enthusiasm, and wish God-speed to those who stay and
have served in such a campaign, and have earned the praises of such a
commander.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, with the remainder of the corps, embarked
in the ‘Atlantian’ on December 5, at Cape Town, after a farewell
speech from the Mayor of Cape Town, Mr. T.J. O’Reilly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following appeared in the ‘Cape Times’ of December 6:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>About 2 o’clock yesterday afternoon His Worship the Mayor
(Mr. T.J. O’Reilly), accompanied by the Town Clerk (Mr. C.J. Byworth)
and the Mace Bearer, attended at the South Arm to say farewell to the
Indian Volunteer contingent known as Lumsden’s Horse, under the command
of Colonel Lumsden. The men were drawn up on the South Arm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>alongside of which lay the huge transport ‘Atlantian,’ which was to
convey them to India.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, having called the men to attention, stated that it
was very gratifying to him to know that His Worship the Mayor had so
kindly come down to the Docks to say a few words to them before they
sailed.</p>

<p>CHEERING IN RESPONSE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His Worship said: Colonel Lumsden, Officers, and Men of Lumsden’s
Horse,—I am very pleased indeed to have the honour of saying a few
words to you to-day before you leave South Africa. We are all very
grateful to you for the noble services you have rendered in the field for
us for upwards of twelve months. You are now going home covered
with honour and glory, and I earnestly trust you will find all those you
left behind you well and anxious to give you a hearty welcome, which I
feel sure awaits you on your return. On the outbreak of hostilities in
this country Colonel Lumsden at once offered his services, and also to
organise a corps to proceed to South Africa to fight for Queen and country.
Out of 1,000 men who eagerly offered themselves in response to the call
for volunteers, 250 were accepted. This gratifying response is an eloquent
testimony to the patriotic spirit by which the British race all over the
world are animated. To the public of India and to Colonel Lumsden
belong the credit for the equipment of your corps with everything needful
excepting rifle and bandolier, and I can only characterise the action of
your Colonel as patriotic in the highest degree, and deserving the hearty
thanks of all, apart from the splendid services rendered in the field. I feel
assured that if Lord Roberts were now to ask Colonel Lumsden to again
return to the field, his request would be most willingly and promptly
complied with by one and all of the contingent here to-day, who would be
only too eager to follow their trusted and tried leader to further honour
and glory. Some of your members have fallen in the field fighting
bravely for the dear old flag and the honour and prestige of the Empire.
Others, more fortunate, have secured civil and other appointments in the
country in which they have acquitted themselves with so much credit to
the corps and the country from which they hail. Out of the 250 men
comprised in the corps as originally organised, twenty-five have received
commissions, a most gratifying percentage, while fifteen men have
received civil appointments and thirty have joined the constabulary force
commanded by General Baden-Powell, so that on the whole your corps
have done exceedingly well as regards employment in South Africa. It is
also very pleasing to learn that the contingent holds a splendid record from
Field-Marshal Lord Roberts downwards. I wish to impress upon you the
fact that, after your Queen and the Empire, you were fighting for the vital
principles of right and justice claimed by Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Alfred
Milner, and if Mr. Kruger and Mr. Steyn had been willing to recognise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the equity of such claim there would have been no necessity to have
recourse to the sword. It is recognised that the only man who is capable
of establishing permanent peace and settlement in South Africa is His
Excellency Sir Alfred Milner, and by urging this fact, in season and out
of season, whenever the opportunity occurs upon your return to India
you will be rendering a further service to the country which you have
already placed under a lasting debt of gratitude for services already
performed. We are going to send you a little souvenir of your sojourn
in South Africa, and as a slight token of our gratitude and appreciation
for the great work you have done for us; and as the years roll on and
your children and grandchildren gather around you, probably you may be
asked by a son or a grandson as to the history of the souvenir from South
Africa. In telling the story remember the refrain of the soldier’s song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Roll drums merrily, march away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soldiers glory famed in story.</div>
      <div class='line'>His laurels were green when his locks were grey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah for the life of a soldier.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When you look at the souvenir in after-years, when, perhaps, your
locks are grey, you can always bear in mind that the laurels you have won
in this country will remain ever green with us, and we hope ever green
with you. Colonel Lumsden, officers, and men, I now bid you <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bon
voyage</em></span>, a safe return home, a happy Christmas on board the good ship
‘Atlantian,’ and a bright and prosperous New Year in your distant homes
in India.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden said: Your Worship,—On behalf of Lumsden’s Horse
and myself, I thank you most cordially for the eloquent speech you have
made to-day, and I also thank you for coming down here, I feel sure at
no little inconvenience, to bid us farewell on our departure from these
shores. We shall ever think of the time we spent in South Africa, but I
should like you to understand, Mr. Mayor, that in coming here we were
only actuated by our duty to our Queen and to our country. I have
again to thank you for the trouble you have been good enough to take
in coming down to the Docks this afternoon, and to assure you that we
greatly appreciate your courtesy and kindness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden then called upon the officers and men to join with
him in giving three hearty cheers for the Mayor, and the call was
enthusiastically responded to. His Worship then shook hands with the
Colonel and officers, and expressed the hope that the men would enjoy
their voyage and have a happy Christmas.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>So, amid cheers and many good wishes, Lumsden’s Horse
took their farewell of South Africa, leaving behind them a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>reputation of which any regiment might have been proud. They
had fought side by side with Regular soldiers of the British
Army, and earned a character for courage among men whose
self-sacrificing devotion they, in turn, regarded with admiration
and strove to emulate. They had made many friends among
all branches of the Service, Imperial and Colonial, and had won
the respect even of their enemies. It had been their good fortune
to serve under three at least of the ablest leaders who came to
the front in the course of that long campaign, and from every
one of these they won commendation as a body of troopers on
whom reliance might be placed in any emergency. No better
name need any soldiers want to take home with them and hand
down to their children’s children.</p>

  <h2 id='chap19' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <span class='small'><i>THE RETURN TO INDIA—WELCOME HOME—HONOURS <br />AND ORATIONS—DISBANDMENT</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On arrival at Cape Town, Colonel Lumsden was told that the
accounts of his corps were the only pay-sheets of any Irregular
contingent that had been kept up to date; and the men of
Lumsden’s Horse left South Africa not only in possession of
every shilling of pay then due to them, but just as they had
left India ten months earlier, owing not a debt in the country,
though the country owed them much in the form of obligations
that can never be forgotten except by the men, who, conscious
of duty nobly done, need no other reward. They were leaving
South Africa assured by every testimony that high approval could
give that they had done their duty and done it well. They had
with other soldiers taken their full share of great hardships.
The weariness of long marches, the trying ordeals of exposure to
fierce heat by day and bitter cold at night, sometimes drenched
to the skin when they lay down to rest on the bare veldt with no
tent to shelter them and not always a blanket to cover them, at
other times benumbed by the icy coldness of a wind that
stiffened their wet khaki tunics with frost which the sluggish
blood had not warmth enough to thaw—all these things they
had borne with a manly fortitude that won the respect of war-hardened
veterans; and they were going back with the knowledge
that the Commander-in-Chief of such an army as Great Britain
had never sent to war before in all the long course of her Empire-making
history, had signified his approval of their conduct in
that telegram to the Viceroy of India expressing recognition
of the excellent service rendered by officers, non-commissioned
officers, and men, of whom he said: ‘It has been a pride and
a pleasure to me to have under my command a Volunteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>contingent which has so well upheld the honour of the Indian
Empire.’</p>

<p class='c000'>With these words assuring them of a great soldier’s appreciation,
they were going back to the certainty of an enthusiastic
welcome from the people of India, to whose honour all the good
deeds of Lumsden’s Horse redound. Of the warmth of that
welcome His Excellency the Viceroy had given them a foretaste
when, in his reply to the message received from Lord Roberts,
he sent back by cable the inspiriting words: ‘India will welcome
those who are coming back with enthusiasm and wish God-speed
to those who stay.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It was with knowledge of the deep interest taken by Lord
Curzon in all things concerning Lumsden’s Horse that the
Commander-in-Chief telegraphed to him something more than a
formal recognition of their services. It was with characteristic
intuition and tact that the Viceroy replied, giving voice to the
wishes of a whole people and expressing those wishes in the
choicest of phrases. In this telegram Lord Curzon epitomised
the meaning of all that he had said or done for the welfare of
Lumsden’s Horse since the corps was formed nearly a year
earlier, and his desire that its services should be recognised both
officially and publicly as a bond between India and the Mother
Country—an epoch-making event in which all classes of the
Empire might equally take pride. All this and more His
Excellency continued to demonstrate by the share he took in
welcoming the warriors home, when his eloquent words appealed
alike to the quick sympathies and to the intelligence of those
who heard him speak, or read what he had to say. And long
after the flood of popular enthusiasm had reached its height
he continued to manifest his interest in the corps by practical
efforts to benefit its surviving members, and by a most graceful
tribute to the memory of those whose lives had been sacrificed
for the honour of the Empire. At his own cost, Lord Curzon
erected a tablet in St. Paul’s Cathedral, Calcutta, on which was
inscribed the name of every man of the corps who had died in
South Africa, and himself wrote the touching lines that will
through after-ages commemorate the services they rendered.
Throughout, Lord Curzon’s great aim was to foster and encourage
the spirit of volunteering, the importance of which to a world-wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Empire nobody realises more fully than he. As a proof of
his conviction in this regard, he has succeeded in getting an
Inspector-General of Volunteers appointed on the Staff in India,
and the first holder of this office is Major-General Hill, of the
Bombay Staff Corps.</p>

    <div>HOME FROM SOUTH AFRICA—N.C.O.S AND TROOPERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Directly it was known through the telegram sent by Lord
Roberts from Irene that Lumsden’s Horse were actually on their
way home, a committee met at the Chamber of Commerce and
elected Sir Patrick Playfair as its chairman. This body was
thoroughly representative of the mercantile community and all
the complex elements that constitute the most influential
sections of society in Calcutta. It included judges, barristers,
doctors, solicitors, besides the most prominent native merchants
and princes, and formed altogether one of the most typical
assemblages ever known in the city. It was called to decide what
sort of reception should be given to Lumsden’s Horse, and its
deliberations closed with the unanimous resolve to make the
occasion worthy alike of a great country and of those who had
fought for its honour with a courage and devotion characteristic
of British soldiers. The decision was telegraphed to His
Excellency the Viceroy, who was at that time absent from
Calcutta on tour. The Committee were very anxious that
Lumsden’s Horse should arrive in time to take part in the New
Year Proclamation Parade commemorating the Empress of
India’s accession, when, according to custom, there is a great
military concentration in Calcutta of Regular troops, Volunteers,
and all branches of the Imperial Service to be reviewed by the
Viceroy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to Sir Patrick Playfair’s message the following
telegram was received:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>Copy of a Telegram from U.S.V. to Sir Patrick Playfair, dated</em></div>
    <div><em>Bangalore, December 8, 1900.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The Viceroy will be very glad to take part in any reception that
it may be possible to organise for Lumsden’s Horse on their return to
Calcutta, and would gladly entertain them to lunch or in some other
way; he consulted military department upon the subject a fortnight
ago, but has received no reply; difficulty seems to be, first, that force is
coming back in separate batches; second, that all of these do not come
to Calcutta, one batch being due at Bombay December 24; it is for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>consideration whether it would be possible to invite the whole force to
Calcutta and give them public reception, but there may be difficulties in
this course.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>About this time the Executive Committee received a most
gratifying tribute to the reputation that the contingent had
made for itself in South Africa. This was an intimation that
Lloyd’s Patriotic Fund had voted 500<em>l.</em>, under the rules of the
institution, towards the expenses of Lumsden’s Horse in acknowledgment
of their services to the Empire. A cheque for this
generous amount had been
forwarded to the Government
of India.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Taking up again the thread
of events, Major Neville Taylor
tells the story of the voyage
from Cape Town to Bombay in
his own cheery way:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>We had no horses to look after
and no drill; no saddles or rifles,
but plenty of accommodation for
the men. I think everyone enjoyed
the rest immensely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding to Durban, we
picked up most of the men who
had left on urgent private affairs
in the ‘Catalonia,’ which had been
unexpectedly stopped at Durban.
After the rough living of the veldt,
the good feeding on board ship
was very welcome, and rapidly told its tale in the condition of the men.
Before leaving Cape Town, the Colonel had authorised the purchase of
extra stores for the men out of the corps funds. Two or three evenings
every week were wiled away with sing-songs, and many hours of each
day devoted to sport of some sort. These gave Trooper J.S. Cowen,
the regimental artist, many opportunities of adding character sketches
to the portfolio that was already well filled with subjects from the war.
On Christmas Day the men had a really good dinner, and the officers
were the guests of Captain Wallace, the kind veteran commander of our
ship, the ‘Atlantian.’ After a very lively voyage, during which but one
ship was sighted since the South African coast sank below the horizon,
we drew near the land of Hindustan once more. A day or so before our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>arrival everyone was very busy putting things clean and straight. On the
morning of December 31 we came in sight of the mark-boat, which was
gaily dressed with flags in our honour and gave us a salute with her gun.
This was the first hint we had of the enthusiastic reception awaiting us in
India. As soon as anchor was dropped, we officers received an invitation
from the General to lunch with him at the Yacht Club, and an intimation
that the men were all to land at 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>On December 26, Brigadier-General Ventris, Commanding at
Bombay, had issued the following Garrison Order:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the expected arrival of Lumsden’s Horse from
South Africa per transport ‘Atlantian’ on or about the 28th inst., the
Officers commanding 2nd Bombay Grenadiers and 21st Bombay Infantry
will be good enough to detail their bands to be in attendance at the
Ballard Pier at 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> (on date to be hereafter notified).</p>

<p class='c000'>All Officers of the Garrison, Regular and Volunteers, are invited to be
present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dress.—Review order, summer clothing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The following appeared in the District Orders for the next
day:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On the arrival of Lumsden’s Horse they will be marched from the
Ballard Pier to Victoria Terminus, <em>viâ</em> Elphinstone Circle, Church Gate
Street, and Hornby Road.</p>

<p class='c000'>The troops and Volunteers in garrison will line each side of Hornby
Road from the Floral Fountain to Victoria Terminus in the following
order, on Friday, the 28th inst., commencing at the Floral Fountain:
Royal Garrison Artillery; Norfolk Regiment (Detachment at Colaba);
2nd Bombay Grenadiers; 21st Bombay Infantry; Bombay Volunteer
Artillery; Bombay Volunteer Rifles; and 1st B.B. &amp; C.I. Railway
Volunteer Rifle Corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bombay Light Horse will, if possible, furnish a mounted escort.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Regular troops will rendezvous at the Floral Fountain and the
Volunteers at the Victoria Terminus at 7.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> As Lumsden’s Horse
pass, troops should shoulder arms. When they have reached Victoria
Terminus troops may march to quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dress.—Review order, summer clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The signal for the arrival of the transport ‘Atlantian’ with Lumsden’s
Horse on board will be four guns to be fired from the Saluting Battery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Officers commanding corps are requested to have someone at the
Saluting Battery up to 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 28th inst., to ascertain if the
transport is signalled. Should the steamer be signalled after 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the
parade will not take place till the 29th inst. at the same hour.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>The ‘Atlantian,’ however, did not reach Bombay Harbour

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The people of Calcutta bid you and your gallant corps welcome.
They are proud of the way in which Lumsden’s Horse has represented
India against Britain’s enemies. They wish to do you honour on arrival
in Calcutta. You will be given a public reception, and the military bands
will play you into your camp. It is proposed that your corps should
take part in the Proclamation Parade on the morning of January 1, and
then attend a special Divine Service at the Cathedral. His Excellency
the Viceroy will entertain the corps at luncheon on Wednesday, January 2,
and the reception committee are organising an evening party in the
Town Hall for the night of the same day.</p>

    <div>HOME FROM SOUTH AFRICA—N.C.O. AND TROOPERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Sir Patrick Playfair supplemented his telegram by a
characteristically cordial letter which Colonel Lumsden found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>also awaiting him when the ‘Atlantian’ reached Bombay two
days later:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c019'><span class='small'>Calcutta: December 24, 1900.</span></div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>My dear Lumsden</span>,—Welcome back to India! You and your gallant
men have done splendid service, of which your countrymen in India, and
your native friends here, are justly proud, and you will have a great
reception. Owing to the numbers that wish to give you and the members
of your corps a hearty welcome, it may not be possible to inaugurate a
public banquet, and the alternative may be a reception in the Town Hall
on the evening of the 1st if His Excellency the Viceroy can be present
after the State dinner at Government House.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Viceroy is taking the keenest interest in the return of the corps,
and is considering what had best be done. He has expressed his wish to
give the corps a luncheon at Government House.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is suggested that you should arrive here on the evening of the 31st
or at dawn of the 1st, and be accommodated in camp on the Maidan and
take part in the Proclamation Parade on the morning of the 1st, attend a
short service in the Cathedral, and have a reception in the Town Hall in
the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>A meeting has been called, to be held in the rooms of the Bengal
Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, the 26th, to form a Reception
Committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>You will be brought across at Government expense, and when in camp
the corps will draw ration pay, and the Executive Committee of Lumsden’s
Horse will arrange as formerly for your food while in camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be hoped that all the members of your corps will come across;
and the Viceroy is further desirous that members of the corps who have
already returned to India and taken their discharge should be invited to
come to Calcutta and take part in the parade and public demonstration.
I am, therefore, communicating with those members who have already
returned to India, so far as I am aware of their names and addresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The corps will be disbanded here, and the members will receive
warrants for railway fare to their homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Expenses connected with the public reception of the corps will be met
independently of the Lumsden’s Horse Fund. There is a balance here of
about Rs. 14,000 at credit of the fund. From your telegram received from
Durban—for which I thank you—we infer that you are returning with
about Rs. 40,000. The settlement of account for horses originally contributed
by troopers to the corps has yet to be made. This is rather a
large item. If the above balances be left, there should be a fair sum at
the disposal of the corps after liabilities are met.</p>

<p class='c000'>Messrs. King, King, &amp; Co. have kindly undertaken to have <em>sola topees</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>waiting your arrival, as requested by telegram, and also to deliver letters
on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am asking King, King, &amp; Co. to wire to me whenever the steamer is
sighted, and again so soon as they ascertain how many of the corps are
with you—officers and men—on board. This is necessary and desired, as
there is some inconsistency between the military telegraphic information
and that received by me from you with regard to your numbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let me know the date and hour when you will leave Bombay, and
the date and hour when you will reach Howrah; also where, and on
what dates, telegrams will reach you when crossing India.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall not ascertain the programme and details of your reception until
after the 27th, and I shall have to wire all this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bombay may wish to entertain you, and in accepting their hospitality
be sure that their arrangements will bring you to Calcutta in time to take
part in the Proclamation Parade on the Maidan on the morning of
January 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is doubtful if we can mount you. That remains to be seen. If we
cannot do so, the corps must march past, and will probably be formed
into a guard of honour to His Excellency thereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you got your arms with you?</p>

<p class='c000'>Is there anything in the matter of furnishing that the members of the
corps require on arrival?</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall be very glad to see you, old fellow, and join in the hurrahs
that are waiting for you.</p>

<p class='c000'>Please remember me to all your officers and to the members of the
corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>I may write to you again to-morrow, but I cannot delay a letter any
longer in case my communication should miss you.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the warmest greetings to you and your gallant officers and men,
and wishing you all a Merry Christmas,</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden replied, December 31, 1900:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>On behalf my corps please offer my best thanks to people of Calcutta
for promised reception. Much regret we have arrived too late to join in
Proclamation Parade. Our numbers are seven officers and eighty-nine
men. No arms. Our train leaves Bombay 7 to-night, timed arrive
Calcutta 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Wednesday.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The luncheon was a delightful success, as it always is at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Yacht Club. Then all officers went on board and the official
disembarkation was got through.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ‘Times of India’ of January 1, 1901, had the following:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Among those present at the Bunder when the troops arrived from the
‘Atlantian’ were: His Excellency Lord Northcote, Governor of Bombay;
Brigadier-General F. Ventris, Commanding the Bombay District; Lieutenant-Colonel
R. Owen, Military Secretary to Lord Northcote; Captain
Greig, A.D.C.; Colonel Riddell, Assistant Adjutant-General; Major
Butcher, Commanding R.A., Colaba; Captain Oldfield, R.A., Captain
Edwardes, Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General; the Honourable Mr.
Justice Crowe; the Honourable Mr. S.M. Moses; the Honourable Mr.
John R. Greaves; Major A. Leslie, Bombay Volunteer Artillery; Major
Soundy, V.D., Bombay Volunteer Rifles; Major Fowle, R.A.; Captain
Browne; Lieutenant G.W. Moir, Bombay Light Horse; Captain Stoddart,
B.V.A.; Lieutenant Robertson, R.A.; Captain J. Leash, Captain Savage,
Captain Rogers, Lieutenant Deane, Lieutenant Sharp, Lieutenant
Wilkinson, Lieutenant Moens, and Lieutenant Greaves, all of the
Bombay Volunteer Rifles; Prince Samatsingji of Palitana, the Nawab
of Radhanpore, and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside the Bunder shed were drawn up twenty men of the Governor’s
Bodyguard, and a detachment of the Bombay Light Horse under the
command of Lieutenant G.W. Moir.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men belonging to Lumsden’s Horse left the ‘Atlantian’ in two
Government troop-boats, and landed at the Ballard Pier at 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, where
they were given a cordial welcome by the Bombay Volunteers and the
general public, who had assembled at the pierhead in large numbers.
They were loudly cheered, and, forming fours, were marched through the
shed to the pavilion, in front of which stood the Governor, Lord Northcote.
Brigadier-General Ventris presented Colonel Lumsden to His
Excellency who cordially greeted him. The men took up their position
outside the shed, where they were inspected by Lord Northcote.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Governor then addressed the men in front of a large gathering of
spectators. He said: The present opportunity is one that it gives me
great pleasure to avail myself of to extend, on behalf of the Bombay
Presidency, a most cordial welcome to you, members of the gallant band,
some 281 strong, I believe, who left India some ten months ago to serve
our Queen-Empress in South Africa. We have followed with the deepest
interest the fortunes of your gallant corps, and we have read with
pride and pleasure the testimony that has been borne to your valour
and your service by Dr. Conan Doyle in his history of the war and
from many other sources. We read with pride and pleasure how you
gentlemen, sacrificing your ease and comforts and the luxuries of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Eastern life, went forth to do your duty to your country in South Africa—an
object-lesson of patriotism to the Empire, and worthily maintaining
the traditions of Outram’s Volunteers. Well indeed have the
members of Lumsden’s Horse merited the warm eulogium which the
Commander-in-Chief in South Africa paid to you. Most truly did the
Viceroy say that the whole of India would greet your return with
enthusiasm. You gave us in your first fight a taste of the stuff of which
you were made when you cut your way through superior forces, one
detachment of you having been surrounded; and you won our admiration
by your return when, after losing a large percentage of your number, every
member came back with marks of bullets on him. That was but one
incident of your career of honour throughout the campaign. This is not
the occasion for anything in the nature of a long speech. You are about
to proceed to Calcutta, where you will receive a more formal, but not a
more hearty, welcome than we in Bombay extend to you to-day. We in
Bombay have seen too many valiant soldiers, both Native and European, go
forth from time to time to serve the Queen-Empress, not to seize with
pride and pleasure every opportunity of welcoming them back again. It
is with interest that we learn that many of you remain to colonise and
develop those countries which you have aided to enfranchise. Some of
your comrades, alas! sleep their last, an honoured sleep, beneath the
South African veldt. They were men who held their lives as naught
when it came to sealing their loyalty with their life’s blood. To their
memory be all honour and all gratitude paid by their fellows in India. You,
gentlemen, I will repeat once more, have our heartiest congratulation and
our warmest welcome.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, in reply, said: On behalf of the corps which I
have the honour to command, let me offer you our warmest thanks and
gratitude for the very kind and cordial reception you have given us to-day.
I believe the present war was the first which had the honour of calling
out the Volunteers from across the seas, and we as the few who represented
India feel with deep respect and gratitude the warm welcome you
have given us on our return. Gentlemen (turning to his men), I cannot
make a long speech, but I ask you all to give three cheers for the
Governor and the residents of Bombay for having given us such a hearty
welcome.</p>

<p class='c000'>The members of the corps responded to the call lustily, and the crowd
answered again with three cheers for Lumsden’s Horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few brief orders, and the procession formed to march to the
station. It was headed by the Bodyguard and the Governor’s carriage
as far as the Floral Fountain. The band of the B.V.A. then led the way,
followed by the Bombay Light Horse and Lumsden’s Horse. Behind
these came numbers of carriages, and on either side pressed a crowd that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>seemed unable to show its enthusiasm sufficiently. From the offices of
the Port Trust, by Elphinstone Circle and along Hornby Road, every
window was occupied. Handkerchiefs were to be seen waving on all sides,
until even the walls of the houses seemed to awake to the wonder of the
scene. After all, it was one such as India has rarely witnessed. The Imperial
instinct was aroused. The handful of men following the Colonel
they had bravely followed through all the chances and changes of war, by
whom they had stood for the sake of their country while the bullets
whistled and carried death around, were the embodiment of a great idea,
a noble sentiment. And the people saw and appreciated. The crowd
that had assembled to await the arrival of the troops as they passed along
joined in the march. Some pressed eagerly to speak to the warriors—most
were content to realise what it meant, this wave of patriotism.
The band in front changed the march tune. The music seemed to
become more jubilant as the great mass of soldiers and people swung along
in step. Bombay was rejoicing in very truth. The banners hung out from
the buildings told of it. The spirit of gladness pervaded everything. Here
was a grand ending of the old year. What would the new year bring?
A detachment of the Bodyguard had formed a line outside the Victoria
Terminus. The Bombay Light Horse took up a position alongside. The
band of one of the Native regiments played a welcome, and under the portico
Lumsden’s Horse tramped in, followed by an enormous crowd. The
officers of the garrison had arranged to give the corps dinner in the
refreshment-room. When the meal was over the guests were fairly
besieged. In the station itself it seemed as if thousands of spectators
had assembled. They shook hands with Lumsden’s men. ‘Welcome,’
‘Good Luck,’ and ‘A Happy New Year’ were heard everywhere. It was
a great day—one worth waiting for. As the train steamed out of the
station the building resounded again and again with the cheering. On
the line detonators sounded a parting salute, and the crowd, now hoarse
with shouting, dispersed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Major Taylor also deals with these incidents briefly, and then
carries on a lively narrative up to the hour when Lumsden’s
Horse, having made a record journey across India, arrived at
Calcutta:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>When the troops landed there was a great crowd with bands playing.
The Governor (Lord Northcote) made us a speech full of kindly references
and good wishes as he bade us welcome home. The corps then marched
with the band and an enthusiastic throng—among which numbers of
Parsees were particularly prominent—to the railway station. There all
Lumsden’s Horse found themselves the honoured guests of the Bombay
Garrison, officers of the Regulars and Volunteers having combined, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>the most gratifying unanimity, to give us festive welcome. All the
regimental and private baggage had been taken over by our kind hosts
and put on the train, so that all the men had to do was just to march into
the train. Great enthusiasm prevailed. The fine band of a Native
regiment (the 21st Bombay Infantry) played us off, and so, amid much
cheering, the train steamed out, firing a salute in our honour as it passed
over lines on which detonating signals had been placed at regular intervals.
About 10 o’clock at night we passed a Volunteer camp and stopped at the
station, where bands were playing. The whole force from camp was
paraded on the platform, a great honour at that time of night. Then we
went on again at full speed, stopping only for meals at stations, which
were dressed gaily with flags, and at each of these bands of sorts assembled,
and we were entertained free of cost. One halt was called at a very small
station, but even there we were escorted from the train to the dining-tent
by the best band they had. It was native and local, its instruments being
one big drum, two kettledrums, three flutes, two penny whistles. That
was all they could do, but they did it. Their desire to honour us was
evident, though their means were small—except the big drum—and this
demonstration touched us perhaps even more than the most elaborate
ceremonials prepared for our reception. Eventually, at about 7 o’clock,
we reached Calcutta, having performed the journey in record time, which
was due entirely to the skill, kindness, and courtesy of Mr. T.R. Wynne,
manager of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, who caused all other traffic
to be shunted wherever necessary in order that Lumsden’s Horse might
keep faith with the multitude of friends who were waiting to welcome
them in the city from which they had set out.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The following orders were issued by the military authorities at
Army Headquarters:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Lumsden’s Horse will be accorded a public reception on their arrival
in Calcutta at about 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on January 2.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General Officer Commanding and Staff will meet Lumsden’s
Horse at Howrah station; regimental and departmental officers not on
duty are invited to attend. Dress: drill order, serge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant-Colonel Swaine, R.I.R., will command the troops; Staff
Officers, Major Carpendale and Captain Hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following arrangements will be made at Howrah:</p>

<p class='c000'>On the arrival of Lumsden’s Horse a procession will be formed. The
Calcutta Light Horse will form the advanced guard, followed by the 14th
Bengal Lancers. Regimental bands will follow in the following order:
2nd Madras Infantry, 7th Bengal Infantry, Royal Irish Rifles Volunteers.
Then will follow General Officer Commanding and Staff and Lumsden’s
Horse. The several Volunteer corps will be formed up in line in the order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>hereinafter detailed, with ranks opened and facing inwards to form a lane,
and as the procession passes they will in succession ‘shoulder arms.’ On
Lumsden’s Horse passing the Calcutta Port Defence Volunteers, the
several Volunteer corps will join in the procession in the order in
which they are standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The units will be formed in the following order, commencing from
Howrah station: E.I.R. Volunteers, E.B.S.R. Volunteers, 3rd Battalion
C.V.R., 2nd Battalion C.V.R., 1st Battalion C.V.R., Cossipur
Artillery Volunteers, C.P.D. Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The procession will proceed along the following route: Hugli
Bridge, Strand Road, Clive Ghat Street, Clive Street, Dalhousie Square
North, Dalhousie Square East, Old Court House Street, the Lawrence
Monument, to Lumsden’s Horse Camp pitched on the Maidan between
Calcutta and Plassey Gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fort William Garrison will line the route from Government
Place to the camp in the following order: 20th Bombay Infantry, 2nd
Madras Infantry, Royal Irish Rifles, No. 9 Company E.O.R.G.A., 45th
Battery R.F.A.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Lumsden’s Horse reaching their camp, officers commanding
corps will form up independently and march to quarters. Should the
arrival of Lumsden’s Horse be delayed till after dark, torches will be
provided, with reference to which subsidiary orders will be issued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Definite information as to the time of arrival will be circulated at
noon on January 2.</p>

<p class='c000'>Corps should be in position twenty minutes before the train is due.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chief Commissariat Officer will provide transport for the baggage
of Lumsden’s Horse, and the 7th Bengal Infantry will furnish an escort
of a N.C.O. and twelve men to escort the baggage from Howrah to
Camp.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Major Carpendale, of the Bombay Cavalry, acting as Garrison
Quartermaster, with great kindness took upon himself all arrangements
for the camp. This was pitched on the glacis of Fort
William, overlooking the broad Maidan, and provided with every
necessary article of equipment, the mess tents and others being
in all respects complete and comfortable. The following
appeared in the ‘Englishman’ of January 3, 1901:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Punctually at 5.30 yesterday evening, the time previously announced
for its arrival, the eagerly awaited train bringing Lumsden’s Horse from
Bombay, drew up alongside the new arrival platform of the Bengal-Nagpur
Railway Company at Howrah. The scene which the station presented
to the returning Volunteers must have struck those who were not
wrapt up in more important personal concerns as exceptionally bright
and picturesque. The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal (His Honour
Sir John Woodburn) paid to the corps and its commanding officer the
great compliment of coming with his Staff and a brilliant escort to receive
them at the station. Outside, where the Bengal Lancers in their
striking uniforms, with pennons flying, together with the Calcutta Light
Horse, were drawn up, were long rows of tall Venetian masts, from which
strings of gaily coloured flags fluttered. ‘Welcome’ in bold white
letters on a groundwork of red appeared as the chief feature of an ornamental
arch facing the entrance. The roof of the platform itself and the
pillars were most tastefully decorated with festoons of evergreens and
arrangements of bunting. When mention is also made of the ladies
occupying specially erected stands on either side of the gateway, and of
the large and representative assembly of officials, military and civilian,
gathered, sufficient has been said to warrant the men of Lumsden’s Horse,
as they looked out from the carriage windows, feeling that Calcutta was
not unmindful of them and had prepared a fitting reception. As the
coaches came to a standstill the friends of the ‘boys in khaki’ flocked
round to bid them welcome by a hearty grip of the hand, to exchange
greetings and news. There were no scenes. Britons do not, as a rule,
make public parade of their deepest feelings. The occasion, moreover, was
a gladsome one, and it did all present good to note the magnificently
robust health of the men displayed in their sturdy figures and ruddy and
bronzed faces; all looked remarkably fit, and none more so than the
gallant Colonel himself, who was first to step from his carriage. He at
once walked towards the group where the Lieutenant-Governor, Bishop
Welldon, General Leach, and other distinguished personages were standing.
After a course of hand-shaking, the Colonel directed his attention to the
detraining of his men. Soon they were busily engaged in getting out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>their kits. When this task was accomplished, they were formed into line
and His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor said:</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden,—The citizens of Calcutta give you and your gallant
men of the Indian contingent a very hearty and enthusiastic welcome.
You have had a hard time abroad, and suffered great privations. But I
should like you to know that your career has been followed by those
left behind in Calcutta with the greatest admiration and pride. Gentlemen
all, let us give Colonel Lumsden and his gallant men three hearty
cheers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Needless to say there was a quick and cheerful response to this
request, and before it had quite subsided Sir John called for ‘one cheer
more,’ which was given with equal heartiness. Colonel Lumsden, in a
voice the huskiness of which betokened the depth of his feelings, called on
the men of the Indian contingent to respond with ‘three cheers for the
Lieutenant-Governor.’ Their effort emphasised the fact that in lung
power and appreciation for Sir John Woodburn their trip to South Africa
had effected no deteriorating influences, nor was there anything wanting
in the worth of the response to the gallant Colonel’s call for ‘one more
for the citizens of Calcutta.’ The men then formed fours and marched
out to receive the welcome of the thousands collected round the approaches
to the station and along the route.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among those present on the platform were: The Hon. Mr. Cotton,
Chief Commissioner of Assam (now Sir Henry Cotton, K.C.S.I.); General
Leach, commanding Presidency District; the Most Rev. Dr. Welldon,
Metropolitan of India and Lord Bishop of Calcutta; Major the Hon.
E. Baring, Military Secretary to the Viceroy; Sir Patrick Playfair; Mr.
R.T. Greer, Chairman of the Calcutta Corporation; Rev. Mr. Jackson;
Mr. Harry Stuart; Mr. Apjohn, Vice-Chairman Port Commissioners;
Major Harington, Commandant Artillery Company C.P.D.V.; Captain
Bradshaw, Artillery Company C.P.D.V.; Major Churchill, commanding
9th E.D.G.R.A.; Captain Deverill; Lieutenant-Colonel Meade, Officiating
Commandant Calcutta Volunteer Rifles; Dr. J. Neild Cook, Health
Officer; Mr. Dring, Agent E.I. Railway; Major Cooper, C.V. Rifles;
Colonel Master, Assistant Adjutant-General; Captain Iggulden, Deputy-Assistant
Adjutant-General; Mr. H.M. <a id='corr395.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Rustomji (errata)'>Rustomjee</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_395.35'><ins class='correction' title='Rustomji (errata)'>Rustomjee</ins></a></span>, and a host of
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was about a quarter to 6, the dusk just merging into dark, when
the picturesque procession swung over the bridge. The Calcutta Light
Horse, neat and trim, sitting firmly in their saddles, composed the
van. The Native Cavalry from Alipur followed—great black-bearded
men mounted on fretting horses; then the bands of four regiments, the
2nd Madrasis, the 20th Bombay Infantry, the Royal Irish Rifles, and the
Calcutta Volunteers. Immediately behind were Lumsden’s Horse—on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>foot. The bridge and its approaches were packed with seething masses
of people, who were with difficulty restrained from breaking through the
ranks of the Calcutta Port Defence and the Rifle Volunteers who lined
each side of the roadway and brought up the rear of the procession
after Lumsden’s Horse had passed through.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Calcutta side of the bridge a novel element was introduced,
the flanks of the column being illuminated by numbers of men carrying
acetylene lamps on poles—a very efficient substitute for torches. The
route taken was almost an historic one, for by it all our great Viceroys
have entered Calcutta; but it may safely be said that never have the
Strand Road, Clive Road, and that stretch flanked by magnificent buildings
which leads direct to the Maidan, witnessed scenes of more moving
enthusiasm than when Lumsden’s Horse, after perils oft and tribulations,
came marching home again. From Howrah to the camp on the Maidan
the roadway and buildings beside were lined with the densest masses of
humanity the eye can conceive. The spectacle was a striking illustration
of the variety and numbers of the population of Calcutta. Naturally
the crowds were thickest in the northern part of the route, where the
close-packed Native city contributed its thousands, but even in the more
European part of the town one wondered whence the sightseers had
come. It is probably no exaggeration to say that so large a multitude
of civilian Europeans has never before been drawn together for a similar
demonstration in the East.</p>

<p class='c000'>The decorations were most tasteful, especially down Dalhousie Square
South and Old Court House Street, where the larger shops were brilliantly
lighted behind the groups of well-dressed people who thronged the verandahs
and balconies. Partly because the Oriental is by nature averse to violent
demonstration, and partly because there does not exist in India that class
which ‘mafficks’ in London streets, there was never any real roar of
sustained cheering, but there could be no mistaking the reality and
fervour of the emotion that shook the crowd as the returning warriors
marched along. Besides, no man of Lumsden’s Horse could have
regretted the absence of that which made more touching felicitations
possible. The repression of the masculine desire to express feelings
by making a noise afforded the feminine element an opportunity of
extending a pretty and graceful welcome by waving handkerchiefs and
little flags, and uttering with each flutter some tiny cry of admiration and
delight, which reached distinctly the ears of those for whom it was
meant. The second part of the route was lined by the troops in garrison,
including the battery from Barrackpur. Along the Maidan roads
down to the camp the crowds were the least dense, but represented the
most wealthy sections of the community. In dealing with them there
was not the same necessity for police supervision, and if people broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>through the line of soldiers, rushing forward to welcome their friends
in the ranks, and escorted them to the camp, why, no harm was done.
Indeed, unrehearsed incidents of this kind added the final touch to the
heartiness and friendliness of India’s greeting to those who had fought for
our Empire in a far country. When the long procession drew near Government
House in the gathering darkness, H.E. the Viceroy and Lady Curzon,
with their children and a large number of the Viceregal Staff, walked to
the south-east gate, and, standing on the roadway, waved a welcome to the
corps as it marched past. The roads on each side, and hence through the
Maidan skirting Eden Gardens, were lined by companies of the Royal Irish
Rifles. Of course, the appearance and bearing of the Volunteers whom
all had assembled to honour were keenly watched. The men had grown
leaner and browner than when they sailed away, and their marching was
in strong contrast to the stiff upright gait of the Port Defence Volunteers
behind them. It happens that in the stern, actual business of war men
learn to grasp only essentials. These returning soldiers had plumbed the
realities of life. Hunger they had known, and thirst, and heat, and cold,
and wounds, and the ever-present risk of death. In such conditions the
formalities that surround the British Army in peace time drop away.
Soldiers learn—and their officers too—that, for instance, it matters not
how one marches so long as one does march. Thus it is that Lumsden’s
Horse came through the streets of Calcutta with bodies swinging carelessly
forward, with eyes eager and roving instead of being fixed at
‘attention,’ with ranks loosened instead of being set in compact stiffness.
It has sometimes been said that war spoils men for drill. But it is something
that the Volunteer ranks in India have been leavened by men who
know what campaigning is really like. The feeling of those Calcutta
Volunteers who assisted in the procession was thus partly one of pride, for
were not Lumsden’s Horse also of themselves, and partly of prospective
gratitude, for had not the successes of their comrades in the great war
opened the way for their own employment also? No longer can it be
said that unless Volunteers attain an irreproachable precision in drill and
smartness in bearing they are useless as fighting men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Large crowds of well-dressed persons, natives, and equipages of all
descriptions followed the corps up to the camp, where gunners of the
45th Field Battery lined the way. On arrival there three hearty cheers were
given for the men of Lumsden’s Horse, the cheers being repeated over and
over till the men were dismissed. In camp the scene was an animated one.
Men of the corps, singly and in groups, were centres of attraction to friends
and strangers alike. Conversation was free, eager questions being good-humouredly
answered, and questions repeated and answered over and over
again. The scene was well illuminated. A well-ordered little camp of
twenty tents has been pitched on the old cricket ground of the Calcutta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Cricket Club, exactly south of the Eden Gardens. The camp has been
furnished in ordinary military style and is pitched in rows of three, with
one tent for the officers of the corps, a large mess tent, a canteen, and
the usual necessaries. Camp furniture only is allowed, consisting of a
wooden folding-bed with a straw mattress and pillow, and a few zinc tubs
and basins for lavatory purposes. The mess tent consists of four fly
tents, open at the sides, with a long table, big enough to accommodate
a hundred hungry men, running along its entire length.</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner, the men were formed up at 8.45 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> and marched
into the Town Hall, where they arrived at 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> After a short stay
downstairs they were ordered upstairs, where a most brilliant reception
awaited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>This evening reception at the Town Hall was an entire success.
The decorations of the hall were most elaborate and characterised by
great taste.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the landing upstairs, in addition to greenery in profusion, a
number of naval 9-pounders and a Hotchkiss machine gun, Nordenfeldts
and Maxims were arranged to form a central group, all these being flanked
by a number of small ancient ship’s brass cannons and howitzers.</p>

<p class='c000'>A daïs was erected in the centre of the hall, facing the main entrance,
which was occupied by His Excellency the Viceroy, Lady Curzon, His
Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, the Commander-in-Chief, General Leach,
Sir E. Buck, Bishop Welldon, Sir F. Maclean, Lady Jenkins, and others,
while the space in front was roped off, and here stood in lines the members
of Lumsden’s Horse, whose Colonel, as the Viceroy’s party passed through,
presented to His Excellency every officer of the corps in turn. No time
was lost, after the arrival of Lord and Lady Curzon, in proceeding with
the object of the gathering.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Excellency the Viceroy said:</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, Officers and Men of Lumsden’s Horse,—It is not
yet a year since I was bidding you farewell at Kidderpur Docks. You
had appointed me the Honorary Colonel of a corps of Volunteers that
had never seen warfare, but that was starting out at the call of duty, and
in many cases at great personal sacrifice, to fight for the Queen and the
Empire. Now you have come back, the war-stained and laurel-crowned
veterans of a long and arduous campaign; and we are all here this evening
to welcome you home and to do you honour. I, your Honorary
Colonel, am as proud of you as if I had been through the campaign at
your side, which being a man of peace I am very glad to think that I was
not called upon to do; and all of us here, the citizens of Calcutta
who subscribed to your outgoing, and have kept a watch upon you ever
since, feel a sort of parental glow at receiving back again our one corps
of Indian Volunteers to South Africa, who have shown that the Englishman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>in India is not one whit behind his countrymen at home or his
cousin in the Colonies in daring and risking and suffering for the flag that
waves above us all.</p>

<p class='c000'>For we know well through what hardships and experiences you have
passed since you steamed away down the Hugli in February last. The
one characteristic that has struck me most in this South African campaign
has been the physical strain and suffering which it has imposed. We
have robbed travel and sport and adventure nowadays of most of their
roughness, but war, even when your enemy is out of sight, and you
scarcely ever set eyes upon him, though it has lost in romance, has not
lost, nay—I think it has gained—in peril and privation. We have followed
you in your breathless marches across the dismal veldt, in your assaults
upon those deadly kopjes, in your days of endurance and fighting, in
your grim nights under the cold stars. We have commiserated you when
some of your number were taken prisoners, but we were consoled when
we heard that you were more frequently the pursuers than the pursued,
that you captured far more of the enemy than the enemy did of you.
We felt a thrill of pleasure when you were praised by the Generals and,
above all, by the brave old Field-Marshal who knew what our men from
India could do; and when you were publicly thanked in despatches we
all of us felt as if our own names had appeared in the ‘Birthday Gazette.’
One thousand five hundred miles of marching, twenty-nine actions of one
kind or another—and all this in the space of ten months. This is not
a bad record for our pioneer body of Indian Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was delighted, Colonel Lumsden, that in one respect you most
strictly obeyed the final instructions which as your Commanding Officer,
in mufti, I ventured to address to you in February of last year. I urged
you and your men to be there or thereabouts when the British forces
entered Pretoria. Knowing your keen sense of discipline, it was with no
surprise that I learned that on June 5 Lumsden’s Horse marched into
that place in the van of Lord Roberts’s occupying force. I only regret
that I did not issue a few more timely injunctions to you, such, for
instance, as the capture of General De Wet, since I have little doubt
that you would have carried them out to the letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was one other remark that I made a year ago to which I must
allude. I said that there were some among those whom I was addressing
who might have to face the supreme peril without which war cannot be
waged. You all of you carried your lives in your hands, and a few of
your number have handed in your cheques at the great audit. But we
rejoice that it was only a few—a brave and heroic fraction, but still only
a fraction. You lost your second in command, the gallant Major Showers,
whom Nature had intended for a soldier and whom destiny in his first
encounter claimed as a hero. But besides him only five others were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>killed, while two only died of disease in the entire campaign. Indeed,
the total casualties were fewer than twenty-four, which in a force of over
250 men is, I think, a very remarkable result. I doubt not that all the
rest of you have often faced death, and that many have triumphed over
disease. So much the more cause is there for satisfaction at coming
back on your part and for rejoicing on ours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, I am only addressing less than one half of the force
that mustered before me a year ago. Some have stayed behind in Africa
to continue, in the Regular Army, in the police, or in civil appointments,
the good service which they have rendered during the past ten months.
Though they are far away, and have cut the painter from India, we
include them in our gratitude and well-wishes to-night. Others have
already gone back to their Indian homes, and have been unable to
attend here to-day. We honour them in honouring you. In their
distant plantations or in their employments, wherever they may be,
possibly they will read of this gathering, and will know that they equally
have their places in our reception. As for the rest of those here present,
you, Colonel Lumsden, will always have the pride of recollecting that it
was to your initiative and liberality that this corps owed its being, and
that in the history of the war it bore your name with credit and without
a stain; while you, officers and men, as you revert to your several
avocations in civil life, and as the past year fades into a hazy dream,
will never forget that at a critical moment in the fortunes of your country
you came forward, and staked much, endured much, and wrought much for
the honour of the greatest thing on earth—namely, the British name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Officers and men, it was a pride to me to bid you God-speed nearly a
year ago. It is an inexpressible pleasure to me to welcome you back this
evening, and to thank you, in the name of India, for what you have done
in the service of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden said: Your Excellency, your Honour, Ladies and
Gentlemen,—I feel it, though a pleasure, a hard task to endeavour to
express the feelings of my men and myself for the very hearty welcome
we have received and the very kind speech which our Honorary Colonel the
Viceroy has given us this evening. Our Honorary Colonel mentions,
and with truth, his words of advice in speaking to us on leaving. We
no doubt did our best to act up to it in every way, and I am sure,
speaking for myself as leader, there was no difficulty to do so when
followed by such men as I had. It was not altogether a party of
pleasure. There were rough things and hard times, and I often feared
that the Indian man, accustomed as he always is to the well-known
<em>kai-hae</em>, would not take to the labour of the veldt as well as he did.
I can assure your Excellency that never at any moment when things were
at their worst did I hear a word that was not cheerful and pleasant from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>my men. We have been a fortunate corps in more ways than one.
We have been specially fortunate in our health. As our Honorary
Colonel remarked, only two men in the whole corps died of sickness.
This I think shows in a great measure how well the soldiers were
treated. There have been many complaints, I believe, in several quarters
as to the treatment of the soldiers there. But taking the class of
men I had to deal with, the small percentage of deaths from disease
shows we had not much to complain about in that respect. We
were fortunate also in our list of casualties. We were all very much
touched by the Viceroy’s allusions to those who have gone. No better man
existed than Major Showers, no greater loss could be felt by the corps
than in his death. He died, I believe, as he often thought he would. He
was a soldier to the backbone, and nothing pleased him better than
being in the field. Five died besides Major Showers, giving a total of
six altogether. That out of 250 men may be looked upon as a small
percentage. On the whole, in spite of the hardships the men have gone
through, I think there is not one, if the call to arms were sounded
to-morrow, who would not love to go back again. We were greatly
honoured at having the Viceroy as our Honorary Colonel, and that
pleasure was deeply felt by the men and remained in their memory
throughout the campaign. When any meed of praise was bestowed
upon us one and all felt sure our Honorary Colonel would be pleased to
hear of it. I cannot make a long speech to-night. I think the Viceroy
himself touched upon most of the points of interest connected with the
corps. I can only say how pleased we are with the reception we have got.
When we landed in Bombay the Governor said a few kindly words.
The streets were lined by thousands of people, and we had a welcome
such as we can never forget. Another thing I would wish to touch
upon. I think all the corps are proud of the number of commissions our
men have got. For this we have entirely to thank the Field-Marshal
the Commander-in-Chief. From start to finish there is no doubt his
love of India led Lord Roberts to take a keen interest in our Indian
corps. Our welcome to Calcutta to-day will, I am sure, sink deeply into
all our hearts and be long remembered. I can only say on behalf of
my officers and comrades that I thank you all deeply and sincerely.
In doing so I feel certain I am expressing the gratitude of us all, not
only for what we have received, but what I am told we have yet to
receive. I thank you, Sir, very heartily indeed on behalf of the whole
corps for the extremely kind way in which you have spoken of us and
our work.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The temporary barriers having been removed, the men were
soon busily engaged in conversation with their many friends and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>acquaintances. The band discoursed a bright selection of music
for the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ‘Englishman’ of Friday, January 4, 1901, contained the
following:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday afternoon His Excellency the Viceroy and Lady Curzon
entertained Colonel Lumsden and the officers and men of the Indian
contingent to luncheon at Government House. The function took place
in the Marble Hall. The officers and men of Lumsden’s Horse, who
were in khaki, occupied two long tables running down the centre of
the room at right angles to that at which the Viceroy sat. The floral
decorations of the tables were of an exceptionally chaste and artistic
character. On the verandah the members of the Viceroy’s band were
located, and the most appropriate selection of national and patriotic music
which they rendered contributed largely to the success of the luncheon.
Ninety-two officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of Lumsden’s
Horse were present, and with the guests and Viceroy’s Staff the total
number sitting down to luncheon was 169. A pleasing feature of the
luncheon was the presence of Lady Curzon and the following ladies: Lady
Woodburn, Lady Palmer, Mrs. Harrington, Mrs. Tyler, Mrs. Laurence,
Miss Trevor, and Miss Law. The list of guests also included: His
Honour Sir John Woodburn, Sir Power Palmer, Sir Francis Maclean,
the Metropolitan, Sir Edwin Collen, Sir Arthur Trevor, Sir Edward Law,
Hon. Mr. Raleigh, Hon. Mr. Rivaz, Hon. Sir Henry Cotton, Sir Edward
Elles, General Luck, General Maitland, Surgeon-General Harvey, General
Wace, General Henry, General Dyce, Colonel Buckingham, Sir Patrick
Playfair, Mr. Justice Harington, Sir Henry Prinsep, Sir Allan Arthur,
Captains Taylor, Beresford, Noblett, Holmes, and Powell of Lumsden’s
Horse, Hon. Mr. Bourdillon, Colonel Masters, Colonel Meade, Colonel
MacLaughlin, Major Churchill, Colonel O’Donoghue, Captain Wilson,
Commander Petley, Colonel Swaine, Major Hoore, Captain Bradshaw,
Colonel Wynne, Major Ferror, Captain Ayerst, Rev. J. Hatton, Messrs.
Stuart, Sutherland, Elworthy, Kerr, Tremearne, Woodroffe, Turner,
Greer, and Apcar.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the conclusion of the luncheon the toasts of ‘The Queen,’ ‘Colonel
Lumsden, Officers and Men of Lumsden’s Horse,’ and ‘The Viceroy’ were
enthusiastically honoured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same evening the members of Lumsden’s Horse marched to the
Cathedral to attend a special thanksgiving service for their safe return.
The congregation was a large and most representative one, and included
their Excellencies Lord and Lady Curzon, Sir John and Lady Woodburn.
The service was brief and bright, the musical portion predominating.
The hymns, being well known, were taken up heartily by the congregation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>and a magnificent rendering was given by the choir of the ‘Hallelujah
Chorus,’ to which result the inclusion of a number of ladies in the choir
and an orchestral accompaniment largely contributed. The clergy
present were the Metropolitan, Canons Luckman and Cogan, Revs.
Brown, Gee, Nansen, Kitchen, Clarke, Wickens, Otley, and Campbell,
The men of Lumsden’s Horse occupied the front pews, and at the conclusion
of the service filed out immediately behind the choir and the
clergy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following was the address which the Metropolitan delivered:</p>

<p class='c000'>It is my privilege, brethren, to offer you in the house of God the
words of welcome which have been in all hearts, and upon all lips, since
your landing in India—the last words perhaps that shall be addressed to you
as a military force. It was here on the fourteenth day of February last
that you sought God’s blessing at a special service before setting sail for
the war, and it is here by a natural consequence that you come again to
render Him thanks on your return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brethren, we have followed you with earnest prayers in your long
absence. There has not been a Sunday when we have not entreated God
to bless you, and keep you safe, and to give victory to your arms, and
to bring you home in peace. You will not say or think those prayers
have been unheard. The memory of the friends who were far away, of
their care for you, and their sympathy in your perils must often have
been present to your minds. It may even have happened that you felt
strengthened and inspired, as others have felt by the consciousness, of their
intercession in your behalf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brethren, you have fought, not in a light cause, but for the Empire,
whose members and citizens you are. You have been the witnesses, and
in part the authors, of a new solidarity between the widely severed
forces of the Empire. That solidarity is the great fact, the permanent
result, of the war in South Africa. Its influence upon the destiny of
mankind will be more and more declared in the new-born century. A new
spirit of confederation has dawned upon the Empire, and it is your spirit,
and the spirit of men such as you.</p>

<p class='c000'>May I remind you of a sentence spoken by a high authority on a
critical occasion in modern European history? Goethe relates that after
the battle of Valmy, at which he was present, he was asked by his
comrades in camp to pronounce an opinion upon its significance. He said—and
his language may have seemed extravagant when he used it—‘From
this place, and from this day forth, commences a new era in the world’s
history, and you can all say that you were present at its birth.’ Brethren,
the birthday of Imperial solidarity is likewise an event fraught with issues of
untold power and moment for mankind; but that solidarity has been born
in South Africa, and you can all say that you were present at its birth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>Once more you have realised, and we too, how great and solemn is
the cost of an Imperial destiny. It is not by mere child’s play, but by
sorrow, pain, and death, that a wide-world Empire, like a Universal
Church, is achieved and maintained. You have hazarded your lives,
some of your comrades have laid theirs down, for that high cause; and
the issue of your sacrifice and theirs has been a solemnisation of the
Empire in the last year. It has been good for us that we have known
the reverses and anxieties which ennoble the ultimate victory. We
have felt the hand of God laid upon us. You who have come home, and
we who bid you so glad a welcome, shall spend the residue of our lives
with an enhanced moral seriousness, with a more profound apprehension
of the Providence which regulates and determines human ends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brethren, I shall not detain you longer in this holy place. Only let
your home-coming be worthy of your warfare. There are dangers in
peace as well as in war. Let the spirit, then, of your future lives be
grave, responsible, temperate, sublime, as befits your religion and your
race.</p>

<p class='c000'>May the God of our fathers bless you all, and bring you all to
Heaven!</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The ‘Englishman’ of Monday, January 7, 1901, gave the
following report of another interesting scene:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Immediately after the Thanksgiving Service held at the Cathedral on
Thursday, the officers and men of our pioneer corps celebrated the closing
function of their active military career. It took its form in a dinner
given expressly by Colonel Lumsden, and the guests included Sir Patrick
Playfair, the Hon. Mr. Buckingham, Colonel MacLaughlin, Mr. Harry
Stuart, and several friends of the non-commissioned officers and men.
After an excellent dinner supplied by Mr. Wallace, of the Italian
Restaurant, who also catered for the corps prior to their departure in
February last, the toast of the Queen was proposed and received with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Private Turner, in a very apt little speech, then asked the Colonel if he
would very kindly consent to present, on behalf of the men, to Sergeant-Major
Hewitt, Quartermaster-Sergeant Dale, and Sergeant-Major Brennan,
souvenirs to mark their appreciation of the admirable work done by these
three non-commissioned officers. They always had the knack of taking
the men the proper way. To Quartermaster-Sergeant Dale, <em>alias</em> ‘Daddy,’
or ‘Bobby’ Dale, was due the excellent form in which the men found
themselves. They looked none the worse for their trying marches and
watchful nights simply because the man in charge of the food arrangements
was Dale. Colonel Lumsden said he had much pleasure in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>presenting, on behalf of the men, a silver flask to Sergeant-Major
Hewitt, a silver flask to Quartermaster-Sergeant Dale, and a silver cigar-case
to Sergeant-Major Brennan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Colonel then proposed the health of the Executive Committee,
who, he said, had worked so indefatigably when the corps was being
organised. Their labours did not end there, however, for always while
the corps was in South Africa, and still on its return, they were all
concerned in its well-being and interests. It was a pleasure to
him and to his men to have been the recipients of so hearty a
welcome as that which met them on their arrival at Howrah on the
evening of the 2nd inst. The work which the raising of a force such
as Lumsden’s Horse entails is extensive, complicated, and laborious, but
thanks to the able committee formed on the inception of the corps, they
were able to be equipped and despatched to the country they had just
returned from with comparatively no delay. To Sir Patrick Playfair
particularly he was deeply indebted for his energy in seeing things put
through in such an efficient manner and without a hitch, and he was
proud of now having an opportunity of asking his men to drink the health
of the gentlemen of the Executive Committee, with three times three
cheers for Sir Patrick Playfair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Patrick Playfair, in reply, said that he was sorry another very
important public function required the presence of many of the Executive
Committee who otherwise would have been present at this dinner,
Colonel Lumsden, he thought, was too lavish in his praises of the work
done by the Executive Committee. The work was a labour of love, in the
execution of which every member of that Committee took a pleasure and a
pride. He had met and known Colonel Lumsden very many years before
a certain day in November 1899, when he received from Australia a
cable from Colonel Lumsden intimating his willingness to raise and have
equipped a suitable corps capable of giving a good account of themselves
in South Africa. He had the fullest confidence in Colonel Lumsden,
and knew that the class of men to whom Colonel Lumsden had particular
recourse were the right sort. He, therefore, did his utmost to encourage
Colonel Lumsden in accomplishing his noble object. Great obstacles for
a time blocked the way, but in time, by virtue of the personal influence
of His Excellency the Viceroy, the War Office sanctioned the raising of a
corps which has now returned loaded with honours, complimented time
after time by Generals and in official despatches for gallantry in the
field. The Committee always followed with interest the operations of
the corps in South Africa, and it was a pride and an honour to them to
be in a position to say that they were so closely connected with its
formation. He regretted that a few men should have found their
appointments closed against them on their return, but he assured them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>that the Executive Committee, and particularly himself, would only be too
glad to help any man in finding suitable employment. He said he had
already made reference to the cases of men so placed to the Lieutenant-Governor,
and had asked that, all things else being equal, the men
who had served in Lumsden’s Horse should have the preference when
appointments were vacant. Sir Patrick Playfair then thanked Colonel
Lumsden, the officers, and men of the corps for the hearty way in which
they had drunk the health of the Committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sergeant Fraser then, in a very humorous speech, announced to the
Colonel the intention of the men to present him with a sword of honour
as a memento and a token of their respect and esteem. Within the last
few days they had heard the Governor of Bombay, the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal, and the Viceroy himself, express warm admiration of
Colonel Lumsden for the manner in which he had conceived, organised,
and led the corps. But he ventured to consider that the men of
Lumsden’s Horse were even in a better position than these exalted
gentlemen to express an opinion upon Colonel Lumsden, for they had
been with him in South Africa and seen with their own eyes what he had
done. It was in consequence of what they had seen that they now asked
Colonel Lumsden to accept from the men who had been his comrades a
sword of honour as the highest compliment they knew how to pay him.
He would remind them that Colonel Lumsden, during the action at
Ospruit, had ridden out to the rescue of a wounded trooper, placed him on
his own horse, and led the horse back at a walk a distance of 200 yards,
all under heavy fire.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Colonel Lumsden had never asked his men to go
where he did not lead himself, and it will be within the recollection of all
of them, after climbing kopjes representing Kinchingjunga at six stone,
that they invariably found the Colonel on top busy with his binoculars,
whilst they themselves were helpless from loss of breath. His concern
had always been for his men without regard to his own convenience, and
it was because Colonel Lumsden had proved himself both gallant and
unselfish, that they desired to present him with the sword. If they had
a fault to find with Colonel Lumsden, it was that he was too lenient with
misdemeanants. They had frequently seen men marched before him and
sternly interrogated regarding their sins. But the end of such interviews
was generally a private conversation regarding old times in Assam, or
elsewhere, and no punishment. The result was that the men swore by
their Colonel, even those he had been compelled to send to ‘cells’—there
was one of these, half rear, at the present moment loudly applauding all
he was saying. Colonel Lumsden was not only their commanding
officer, but a personal friend to each man, a combination which had led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>to the maintenance of
an extraordinary degree
of discipline. They
were all proud of the
corps they had the honour to belong to, but they
were prouder, if possible, of the officer whose name
the corps bore. The only fault they ever found
with Colonel Lumsden was that he was too lenient
with the men, and in the goodness of his heart
refrained from meting out punishment where it was
perhaps well deserved. However, it is not every
delinquent who would regard that as a fault. The
men regretted that time had not given them an
opportunity of providing the sword for presentation
that night, but it would come in the fulness of
time. The Colonel’s health was then drunk with
musical honours, the men shouting themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='i407'></a></p>
<div  class='figright id027'>
<img src='images/i_b_407_complete.jpg' alt='Ceremonial Sword' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, in reply, said that this was
truly and in every sense the proudest moment of his
life. He had already had the pleasure of making
a few speeches since the corps was raised, but he
found it a difficult thing to hit on words to express
at all adequately his appreciation of the eulogistic
terms in which Sergeant Fraser, on behalf of his
comrades, had referred to him. He always had the
greatest confidence in his men and relied on their
honour rather than on strict and rigid discipline
for the execution of his orders. He knew his men
thoroughly, and saw that they were prepared to
play the game as it should be played, and he felt
proud, as any officer must, of the men he commanded.
The sword of honour proposed to be
presented to him would be his most treasured
possession—he would always be proud to refer to
it and the happy associations it recalled. The past
twelve months had been the happiest in his whole
career, and nigh forty-eight summers had passed
over his head. Turning to Sir Patrick Playfair’s
remark, he said that he, too, would do his utmost
to have the men without billets provided for. He
was a believer in the great future in store for South
Africa, and wished every success to those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>corps who had remained behind. He also said that Captain Petley had
very kindly placed the ‘Koladyne’ at the disposal of those who had no
friends to stay with in Calcutta, and that they only had to signify to
Captain Petley, who had taken a deep interest in the corps, their wish
to avail themselves of this kind offer. He would now say good-bye and
God-speed with every good wish for their future welfare, requesting that,
before breaking up camp, every man should promise to send his photo.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men were visibly touched by Colonel Lumsden’s speech, and,
after cheering him over and over again, chaired him and all the officers,
and Sergeant-Major Stephens, at great risk to those chaired.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Sword of Honour, exquisitely wrought by Messrs.
Hamilton &amp; Co., of Calcutta, and presented to Colonel Lumsden

</div>

<p class='c006'>On January 4, 1901, just one year after they had assembled on
the Maidan full of high hopes and noble aspirations, these
Indian Volunteers, who had made for themselves a name that
will long be honoured among British soldiers, were disbanded.
So the curtain fell on the war scene in which the two hundred
and fifty men known to history as Lumsden’s Horse played their
parts. They had been in the field ten months, marched from
camp to camp over 1,500 miles, fought in thirty-nine actions,
lost seven men killed in action, two from enteric, several at
various times incapacitated by wounds; they had left nearly
sixty of their number in South Africa, some as administrators,
some in the Regular Army, and some in the Police; they had
brought back to Calcutta only four of the horses with which they
started, and had used up 750 remounts. They had been twice
mentioned in despatches by the Field-Marshal, and had been
praised by every General under whom they served. Out of a
total of fifteen officers, one, Colonel Lumsden, was decorated by
Her Majesty Queen Victoria with the C.B.; another, Major
Chamney, received the C.M.G.; two others, Captain Rutherfoord
and Lieutenant Pugh, obtained the D.S.O. The Adjutant
and the two Regular officers who had commanded companies
were promoted a step, to the rank of Brevet-Major. Trooper
J.A. Graham, whose act of valour at Crocodile River has been
recorded, received the Distinguished Conduct Medal; similar
decorations were awarded to Corporal Percy Jones, Troopers
P.C. Preston, H.N. Betts, W.E. Dexter, and Regimental
Sergeant-Major Marsham; while seven other N.C.O.s and
troopers were mentioned in despatches. It is a noteworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>fact that of all those whose names were brought forward by
Colonel Lumsden not one failed to obtain recognition from the
Commander-in-Chief, and only three received less honourable distinctions
than their Colonel thought they were entitled to. All
these things prove that nobody was recommended except for
meritorious services of which clear and conclusive evidence could
be given. All soldiers will appreciate what that means. And of
twenty-three who obtained commissions in the Regular Army and
others gazetted to Irregular corps, only two resigned subsequently.
Colonel Lumsden was exceptionally fortunate in securing this
number of commissions, and still more fortunate in selecting men
worthy to retain them. It must not be forgotten, however, that
the majority of those serving in the ranks of Lumsden’s Horse
were Public School boys, some of whom may have failed in their
examinations for Sandhurst, and gone out to fight their way in
India as indigo, tea, and coffee planters, and who, when the
occasion arose, were just the right men to fill the appointments
they got. Their merits were recognised not only by our own
military authorities, but also by the enemy. One Boer told the
Rev. J.H. Siddons, of Great Berkhampstead, whose letter is
quoted by permission, that Lumsden’s Horse were ‘exceptionally
good both at scouting and shooting.’ The same authority also
says that he had similar testimony to their merits from a corporal
of one of the Cavalry regiments. This is not surprising, as
Lumsden’s Horse and their comrades of the Line were always
on good terms, and had a mutual admiration for each other. In
a letter to the Colonel, Trooper D. Morison says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>I am afraid I cannot help you much with my personal experiences
and views. No doubt everyone who writes you on the subject will be
full of praise and admiration for Mr. Thomas Atkins as we found him
on the veldt. But I should like to record what a splendid chap he is.
Whether Scotch, Irish, Welsh, or from any other part of the country, he
is all the same when it comes to a tight corner.</p>

<p><span class='small left'><em>Photo: Davies Brothers, Johannesburg</em></span><br />MEMBERS OF LUMSDEN’S HORSE WHO JOINED THE JOHANNESBURG POLICE, DECEMBER 1900</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Though the records of active service with Lumsden’s Horse
as a body closed when the corps left South Africa on December 6,
1900, many of its members fought on in the Transvaal with the
same undaunted spirit that had quickened them and their
comrades throughout, the same determination to be true to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>old regimental motto, and ‘Play the Game.’ The following
accounts of the affair at Benoni, in the Boksburg mining district,
give a good idea of the fighting qualities of the Anglo-Indians
who had won their spurs in Lumsden’s Horse:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>At the beginning of December 1900 many of the gallant little band
had enrolled themselves under Major-General Baden-Powell in the South
African Constabulary, others again in the Rand Mounted Rifles under
Mr. Henry, erstwhile Inspector-General of Police, Bengal, whose companies
were then holding entrenched positions at different portions of
the Rand. The one at Benoni for the protection of cattle, refugees,
and the mines was deemed an important duty, as the neighbourhood
had been in a very disturbed state for months past, and from time to
time had been visited by small parties of Boers. These were always
put to flight by the ordinary mounted patrols. But on Boxing Day
at 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the alarm was given that a strong force of Boers was in
the vicinity. Immediate defensive measures were taken, and when a
party of 100 of the enemy rode up to the Post Office, they were accorded
a greeting very different from the Christmas one of ‘Peace and goodwill.’
They scuttled, but later a second party engaged the right flank
of the police post. A second time they were compelled to retire, but
poor dear old Sergeant Walker (Lumsden’s Horse) was killed outright, a
bullet entering his head in the region of the temple. He was the senior
non-commissioned officer, and died bearing his responsibility nobly. The
command then devolved on Sergeant ‘Tim’ Lockhart, also of Lumsden’s
Horse, who displayed great dash and courage, exposing himself at
the most dangerous points, and thus inspiring his men to avenge poor
Walker. In the meanwhile the Boers took up a very strong position on
the left front, from which they harassed the gallant little body of
defenders. Finding that rifle-fire was ineffective, the Boers brought a
pom-pom and a Maxim to bear on the position, and considerable damage
was done to the head-gear machinery of the mine. Lieutenant Evans, in
command of a detachment of the Railway Pioneer Regiment, finding he
could not relieve the brave fellows, despatched Trooper Tooley to Boksburg
for reinforcements. The Boers, however, true to their traditions,
were now effecting a hurried retirement, and to prevent a surprise
Sergeant Lockhart sent out patrols (Troopers Granville, Kelly, and
Lloyd-Jones—all of Lumsden’s Horse). Lloyd-Jones came to grief,
falling from his horse and breaking his wrist, otherwise the movement
was eminently successful. The Boers were retiring in very good order,
and succeeded in doing considerable damage to the New Kleinfontein and
the New Chimes mines, held by Lieutenant Evans and twenty-three men.
Sergeant Lockhart had, all told, eleven men, and two officers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Intelligence Department and Mrs. Hunter, the wife of one of these
gentlemen. The post consisted of twenty-three of all ranks, principally
men of Lumsden’s Horse. Among them were ‘Tim Lockhart’—now
blossomed into a Sergeant of Mounted Police—Walter Walker, Kelly,
Arthur Nicholson, Jones, Harris, Bradford, Kearsey, Petersen, Grenville,
and Tooley; the remainder being Railway Pioneer men. Their duty
was to protect the mines from raids by Boer patrols, and it was in the
head-gear of the mine workings that the defenders ensconced themselves
when the attack was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pom-pom, Maxim, and the rifle-fire of 300 Boers under Viljoen and
Erasmus played merrily on them from 4.20 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> till afternoon, the pom-pom
shells playing havoc with the wood and iron work of the head-gear,
but without hurting anybody.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It has been definitely ascertained that the Boers were 400 strong, and
possessed a pom-pom and Maxim gun. Trooper Harris (Lumsden’s
Horse) was responsible for the work of ‘entrenching
the position,’ and his comrades testify
to the creditable manner in which he executed
his duty. Of the 1,400 head of cattle in the
British laager, not a single one was taken.
Viljoen was in command of the Boers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Walker lies in the Johannesburg cemetery.
He was accorded a military funeral that
was attended very largely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reinforcements under Lieutenant Wynyard
Battye (a cousin of the Indian fighting
Battyes) came up too late to render any immediate
aid, but they pursued the retreating
Boers as far as Springs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between 2 and 3 in the afternoon relief came, but not until
300,000<em>l.</em> worth of damage had been done to machinery and buildings
near. The telegram given below speaks for itself, and it is pleasant reading
that those of our fellows who stayed behind are continuing to play
the game so well.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>Just to show how the reputation of the corps is being kept up and
added to by those who remained in South Africa, I enclose an extract from
a letter received a short while ago from Sergeant Renny, now serving in
the Johannesburg M.M. Police. It gives an account of the heroic death of
Sergeant Walker at Benoni last Boxing Day. Renny says: ‘On December
5, after a fortnight’s stay in Johannesburg, we were sent off in two
parties to take up police duties. One company, consisting of nine men and
Sergeant Walker, was sent to this place (Benoni), the other party going to
Brakpan coal-mines, half-way between Boksburg and Springs. When
we first came here there were four men of the Railway Pioneer Rifles,
together with whom we formed the garrison. We are in charge of 1,300
head of cattle and sheep. We send out patrols every day and mount
three guards every night. Our three guards are posted round the
enclosure where the cattle are kept at night—one about 150 yards in
front, one in an empty dynamite magazine about 250 yards in rear, and
the third one is posted near where we sleep. We live in a corrugated
iron room on the top of a gold dump, half-way up to heaven—that is,
about 30 feet from the ground. A verandah runs round it which we have
fortified with sandbags. We have also dug trenches all round the room,
as a big body of Boers is reported to be in laager twenty miles from us—the
same commando that paid us so much attention on French’s famous
march. We had hardly settled down here before the Boers paid us a
visit. On December 10 I was on guard with a Railway Pioneer Regiment
man, and at 11.30 I suddenly heard the sound of whips, as if cattle
were being driven out of the kraal. I immediately fired two shots in rapid
succession. This had the desired effect of hurrying the Boers out of the
kraal and at the same time of warning the other men. There was a
small moon up and we could just distinguish a dark body of men. At
this we fired as fast as we could load, and had the satisfaction of completely
surprising the Boers, several of whom we hit. They had got all
the cattle out of the kraal, but were in such a hurry to get away that they
left these all behind. They exchanged a few shots when at a safe
distance. But where their bullets went none of us know, as none came
in our direction. After this they left us in peace till December 26.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>G.D. NICOLAY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Reinforced after the first attack, we mustered twenty-seven guns
on the morning of the 26th, a day never to be forgotten by the
little garrison at Benoni. The Boers attacked us at 4.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> in large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>force, numbering over three hundred men, with two pom-poms and a
Maxim. Those not on guard were in bed, when Tooley, who was outside
the room, shouted that the Boers were on us. We rushed out as
quickly as we could, and had just time to get into the trenches before a
body of about fifty Boers charged down upon us in regular cavalry fashion.
We waited till they were within 200 yards and then we gave them a
volley which cooled their ardour a bit and sent them back in hot haste
with a few of their saddles emptied. They then took up positions on
mounds right round us and began to pour in a hot rifle-fire from ranges
varying from 200 to 800 yards, using rifles of every description, even
fowling pieces, as we heard several charges of buckshot scatter over us.
Poor Walker, whom we all liked, exposed himself, and was shot immediately.
We returned their fire as well as we could, bowling over a good few, both
horses and men. We exchanged rifle shots till 9 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, when, finding that
they could not dislodge us, they brought their pom-poms and Maxim up,
and for half an hour gave us as lively a time as
we have ever had. Our room was riddled from
top to bottom, any kit hanging on the walls
being perforated. The noise of the shells going
through the corrugated iron was most terrific
and made us feel pretty queer. We had to lie
low in our trenches, expecting shells to drop into
the middle of us at any moment. The Boers
crept closer under cover of the pom-poms, but
luckily for us the supply of pom-pom ammunition
gave out. Then rifle-fire recommenced and we
soon drove them back to their original positions.
They had fired whole belts of shells at us at a
time. So you can imagine the lively time we had. Rifle-fire was kept
up till 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, when the Boers decamped on seeing reinforcements
arriving from Johannesburg and Boksburg. They burnt two mines and
several dwelling-houses and looted the stores before they cleared out.
We have had great praise for holding out so long—4.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>—and
have received congratulatory telegrams from Lord Kitchener, Sir
Alfred Milner, Colonel McKenzie, Governor of Johannesburg, and Colonel
Davies, Military Commandant of Johannesburg. The Boers were led
by Ben Viljoen, Hans Botha, and Erasmus.’ The names of men with
Rennie were Nicholson, Kelly, G.D. Nicolay, Jones, Petersen, late of
A Company; Harris, Grenville, Bradford, Kearsey, late of Transport;
Tooley, of Loch’s horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. E.R. Henry, lately commanding the Rand Mounted

<div class='c019'><span class='small'>New Scotland Yard: July 31, 1901.</span></div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dear Playfair</span>,—You asked me last night to note down briefly some
details of the attack on the Chimes West mine. Here are the facts as
well as I remember them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had a Police post at this mine on the Rand about nine miles
from Boksburg, a place you will find on all maps. Our force consisted of
sixteen Railway Pioneer Regiment and nine Lumsden’s Horse, the latter
under Sergeant Walker.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of December 26 this small force—which, by-the-by,
was located in what I may term the first floor of the head-gear of the
Chimes West mine—was attacked by 300 Boers, who had with them two
pom-poms.</p>

<div id='i417'  class='figright id028'>
<img src='images/i_b_417.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>H. KELLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Boers fired volleys, and a good many pom-pom shells went
through the quarters occupied by Lumsden’s Horse. I saw dozens of
shell-holes, not only through the iron sheets which formed the walls of
their quarters, but also through the great wooden
beams or baulks of a foot or more in diameter.
From one of the earliest of these volleys Sergeant
Walker was killed as he was kneeling behind a
sandbag.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our men were under fire for several hours,
and, seeing that we were so greatly outnumbered,
Tolley volunteered to ride through the Boers into
Boksburg, a distance of nine miles, and did so—a
gallant feat. Kelly, Grenville, and Jones volunteered
to make a dash for a tailings or dump-heap,
so as to enfilade the Boers. Kelly and Grenville
got home, Jones’s horse fell, and he fractured his
arm and lay there. Kelly and Grenville did excellent work from the
tailings heap, and made it so uncomfortable for the Boers that they had
to shift their position. I was there next day and met General Barton
on the ground. On receipt of his report the Commander-in-Chief, Lord
Kitchener, wired us the following message: ‘Congratulate Police on
gallant defence Benoni. Deplore loss of their sergeant.’ Lord Kitchener
is temperate in praise, so I take it his commendation meant much.
I understand that three of the men whose names I have given above
have been since mentioned in despatches on account of their behaviour
on December 26.</p>

<p class='c000'>E.I. Lockhart, of Lumsden’s Horse, became senior sergeant on
Walker’s death, and is a gallant old fellow. He is much younger than I,
but everyone dubs him old. He behaved very well. His name should
be mentioned in any account of this particular incident.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our men saved the Chimes West mine. What this means you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>infer from what the Boers did to the Modderfontein mine, close by, which
our men could not defend. In less than half an hour the Boers did
damage estimated at from 250,000<em>l.</em> to 300,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>We buried poor Walker on December 27 at Boksburg, and a memorial
has been subscribed for.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hope this gives you the data you require.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours,</div>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>of the corps who were invalided home, and on this account
Colonel Lumsden thinks a tribute of admiration and an expression
of grateful thanks are due to them. Miss Keyser and
her sister Miss Agnes (Sister Agnes) have, since the commencement
of the war, devoted their house, their money, and their
time to nursing officers invalided home from wounds and
sickness, and are still continuing their noble work. Their
contribution to the War Fund has been one of which the nation
may feel justly proud. King Edward’s Convalescent Home,
which their house is now styled, has been indeed ‘sweet
home’—a place of rest and unalloyed comfort—to over 300
officers who have been invalided from South Africa, and the
self-sacrifice of ladies whose days have been devoted to the
alleviation of suffering will be gratefully appreciated by all
those who have received kind treatment at their hands, and by
the British public.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden, on his return to London, applied to
get pay for his men raised to the Colonial standard of 5<em>s.</em> per
diem, but was told by Lord George Hamilton that as Indian
taxpayers would not be asked to contribute to the cost either
of the war in South Africa or of the war in China, it would be
quite impossible to make up the difference between the British
standard of pay and the Colonial standard. The Cape Colony
and Natal Governments had, in special cases, defrayed the
difference out of their own exchequers.</p>

<p class='c000'>On applying to the Secretary of State for War, the Colonel
was informed by Mr. Brodrick that, were his request granted, the
whole of the Yeomanry who went out in 1900 would be entitled
to a similar increase, and therefore he could not assist. Colonel
Lumsden, in explanation, said the request had not been made by
any of the men themselves, but by him on their account, and,
although a sense of duty to them had impelled him to make this
claim, he considered that they would be all the prouder for having
served their country on 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>For nearly eighteen months after the disbandment of the
corps its former Colonel gave up his time to details connected
with it. In the event of another Volunteer contingent being
despatched from India, it is doubtful whether anyone of Colonel
Lumsden’s position and resources would take such an interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>in the force or would have the time to give to work that might
be more properly undertaken by the War Office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden endeavoured successfully to get employment
for those of his troopers who had given up lucrative
engagements to join the corps. There were certain men who
could not obtain their former appointments, and their old commandant
devoted his time and attention to further their interests.
He found that, however willing the Government of India and
the Government of Bengal were to find employment for these
men in Government service as some recognition of what they
had done for the Empire while serving with Lumsden’s Horse,
neither the Viceroy nor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal
had appointments at his disposal owing to the system of
competitive examination for all posts under their administration.
Therefore Colonel Lumsden was greatly indebted to merchants,
tea proprietors, and others for the help they gave him in obtaining
situations for certain of his men. The fact that no appointments
are reserved for the benefit of soldiers or sailors who have
served their country well is a blot on the competitive system both
in India and in England. It may prove to be a serious discouragement
to the desire for volunteering in future emergencies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very few, even among Colonel Lumsden’s most intimate
friends and old comrades, know that after all his hard work he
went out to India again in the first week of December 1901 with
instructions from the War Office to raise another corps of Indian
Volunteers for service in South Africa, provided sufficient
numbers of the right class of men were available. On arrival in
Calcutta, and after consultation with His Excellency the Viceroy,
Colonel Lumsden wrote to Officers Commanding the different
Volunteer corps from whose ranks most of his previous contingent
had been recruited. Their replies showed, however, that the
three great industries, indigo, tea, and coffee, were not in a
position to bear another strain so soon. The Colonel’s sporting
offer therefore came to nothing. His efforts, however, were
appreciated both by the Secretary of State for War and by the
Commander-in-Chief, and duly recognised in a letter of thanks
from the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lumsden and Sir Patrick Playfair have hardly yet
finished their labours in connection with the corps, of which all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>accounts have been carefully audited by Messrs. Lovelock &amp;
Lewes, the actuaries in Calcutta, and have been balanced to a
point showing the expenditure in India to equip the corps, the
remittances made to South Africa for urgent requirements, all
disbursements in connection with the disbandment of the corps,
and the balance that remains. These accounts<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> may be valuable
in the future as guides to the probable expenditure in similar
cases, and they are interesting now as proving the accuracy of
calculations made at the outset, whereby the cost of equipping
and maintaining such a force in the field for twelve months was
estimated at 1,000 rupees per man, exclusive of gifts in kind. In
dealing with accounts previous to disbandment of the corps, much
valuable assistance was given by Major Ramsden, Controller of
Military Accounts, Bengal; but for the completeness and accuracy
of pay-sheets and other regimental documents, great credit is
due to Mr. Fraser, of the Bank of Bengal, and to his assistant
paymaster, Mr. Graves, of the same bank, both of whom did
hard clerical work under difficulties in the office without
neglecting their duties as soldiers. After all expenses are paid,
there will probably be a balance of twenty or thirty thousand
rupees in hand. Colonel Lumsden has suggested that it cannot
be devoted to a better purpose than as a subsidy towards the
maintenance of a paying ward for sick or disabled Volunteers in
the New General Hospital in Calcutta. The general wish
is that this should henceforth be known as the Lumsden’s
Horse Ward in commemoration of men who did good service to
their country at some personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the memory of those who fell in battle or passed through
the portals of sickness to infinite peace in the midst of war Lord
Curzon has paid tribute by the erection of a handsome mural
tablet in St. Paul’s Cathedral, Calcutta. That monument was
unveiled by the Viceroy on March 23, 1902, after Evensong, when
a specially appropriate service was arranged by Canon Luckman.
Members of the Corps were invited to assemble in full dress at
the south transept door of St. Paul’s Cathedral at 6.15 o’clock
that Sunday evening. They entered the Cathedral and passed
in procession, following the choir and clergy, to seats provided
for them in the aisle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>At the conclusion of the service His Excellency the Viceroy,
Honorary Colonel of Lumsden’s Horse, unveiled the brass tablet
he had personally presented to the Cathedral in memory of
those members of the corps who died in South Africa. The
tablet had been placed on the south wall of the entrance to
the chancel, in front of the statue to Bishop Heber. After the
singing of the Offertory hymn the procession was formed in the
following order:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>The Choir.</div>
    <div>The Clergy.</div>
    <div>His Excellency the Viceroy.</div>
    <div>Staff.</div>
    <div>The Executive Committee of Lumsden’s Horse.</div>
    <div>Lieutenant-Colonel Lumsden, C.B.</div>
    <div>Members of Lumsden’s Horse.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The troopers then formed up in front of and facing the
tablet. His Excellency took up a position in front of the tablet;
Lieutenant-Colonel Lumsden standing at the Viceroy’s left, and
the Executive Committee and Staff to the right of His Excellency,
while Canon Luckman offered up the prayers. His Excellency
then unveiled the tablet. The choir sang the hymn ‘Fight the
good fight,’ and the Blessing was pronounced by the Venerable
the Archdeacon, Bishop’s Commissary in charge of the diocese.</p>

<p class='c000'>That tribute to the honoured memory of gallant comrades
was the last scene in which Lumsden’s Horse were to take part.
Thenceforth they could lay aside the frayed and war-stained
khaki and say, ‘I have done my duty.’ To the living as to
the dead Lord Curzon’s eloquent words, with one slight change,
apply:</p>

</div>

<p class='c045'>Captain and Adjutant Taylor contributes the following notes
and suggestions for consideration:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c023'>There were a certain number of points which struck me very forcibly
during the campaign, and I should like to give them for what they are
worth. There may be certain conditions to be considered, the importance
of which outweighs all others, so that the following notes must be regarded
only as an attempt to carry out the duty which every man owes
to his profession, by showing things in the light in which he saw them.
Higher authorities, busy about big affairs, fail sometimes to notice the
important details with which juniors are brought in daily contact.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Spare Horses.</em>—The corps started from India with one horse per
man and the necessary complement of transport animals. There were a
few casualties on the journey, which were replaced at Cape Town, and
the corps began work in good condition, but with no spare animals. The
supposition apparently is that men fall out just as fast as the horses.
This did not prove correct in South Africa, and it is hard to believe that
it would be so elsewhere provided the work required was of an active
mounted kind. Therefore true economy would seem to dictate the
provision of spare horses. Very soon with us a few horses got slight
sore backs, but as every mounted man available was required it was found
impossible to ease these horses; the inevitable result being that after a
few days they were unfit for work. Consequently a similar number of
men had to be taken from the fighting strength and their saddles put into
the carts. As the work continued, more horses gave out, and more loads
were put into the carts. Hence, while the transport animals grew
weaker their loads grew heavier. To take figures. The nominal strength
of the mounted portion of the corps was 250 men; actually the largest
number we ever had in action was 185. The average in the fighting
line was under 150; of the remainder, fifty were short on account of
sickness and casualties, and fifty on account of horses short. Had we
had fifty spare horses, every available man could have been mounted.
As a matter of fact, thirty spare horses would probably have sufficed, as,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>on the principle of ‘a stitch in time,’ the timely ‘easing’ of trivial cases—such
as a slight sore back or temporary indisposition—would have saved
many a horse’s usefulness or life. The further you go, the more necessary
such reliefs become. The exact number of spare horses depends upon
the class of work required. To my mind, this is one of the lessons we
should learn from the Boers, who generally had two horses per man, and
often five. These spare horses can conveniently march with the veterinary
hospital and be taken care of by a small ‘native’ staff. Working
on this principle, Lumsden’s Horse kept every man mounted during
two months’ ceaseless trek, and the horses were practically all fit and
well at the end of it. On the other system each man used up seven
horses in as many months. To put it in brief. A corps of 250 men
and 250 horses, with their baggage, would, at the end of a week’s hard
marching and fighting, be less efficient than a corps of 200 men with
250 horses, in that they would have no more mounted men in the field,
while their transport would have to carry food and kit for the extra fifty
men, in addition to the fifty saddles of the dismounted men, weighing some
five stones each, and also probably the fifty dismounted men themselves.</p>

<p class='c023'>The same principles affect the question of the number of baggage
animals.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Method of Carrying Ammunition.</em>—Our equipment for ammunition to
be carried by the man took the shape of a belt with two cross braces.
On the former were leather pouches to hold packets of cartridges, and
on the latter bandolier attachments to take single cartridges. The
disadvantages were many. (1) It necessitated the man carrying a heavy
weight constantly on his body or else hiding packets of ammunition in
his holsters, whence they were difficult to extract and where he often left
them in the hurry of a dismount. (2) The pouches were a great discomfort
to the men when lying down to snatch much-needed rest in the many
short intervals at their disposal. (3) The whole weight of the ammunition
came on to the saddle when the man was mounted, and went some
way towards causing sore backs. (4) Marching on foot with this load of
ammunition was so irksome that it soon tired the soldier and made him
urge and take every possible excuse for remaining mounted.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>The proposed remedy</em> is to give every man two bandoliers holding
fifty rounds each and a bayonet-belt to take fifty rounds. The bandoliers
to be habitually buckled round the horse’s neck, like collars. When
going into action the man can transfer one or both bandoliers to his own
shoulders even without dismounting. Should he have under-estimated
the amount of ammunition required, and have left one or both of these
bandoliers on his horse, they can be sent for and found with no difficulty,
the distribution being also very simple. Taking the weight of this
ammunition off the saddle helps to save sore back. The man will walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>unencumbered, and consequently will walk more readily, and can do so for
longer distances, besides being in a better state for duties when he gets
to camp. On a similar principle the rifle should not be carried by the
soldier when marching dismounted, as it is better to keep his weight, say
eleven stone, off the horse’s back as long as possible, and it will be longer
if you put the rifle-weight, seven pounds, on to the horse and not on to the
man.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Spare Ammunition.</em>—Anything in excess of this 150 rounds per man
should be, and was, carried on a led mule or horse, who could keep up
with the mounted men.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Picketing Gear</em> caused us much trouble, as every kind of ground
entailed a different stamp of peg—<em>e.g.</em>, a small iron peg did not hold
in sandy soil, wooden ones broke in rocky ground, while the bundle of
rope and pegs was an extra weight on the horse, and caused the saddle
to roll besides making the man less handy at getting on and off his
horse. The remedy was to have no heel-ropes or pegs carried on the
saddle horse, and to substitute three big iron pegs with fifty yards of ‘line
rope’ and a heavy mallet to every fifty men, carried on a pack-animal with
the ammunition mules. On arrival in camp these pegs were driven in,
the line rope stretched between them, and the horses tied to each side of
it by their head-ropes: heel-ropes were not found necessary. This
worked perfectly except on detached duties, when perhaps ten men were
separated for some ‘post,’ when they had to ‘ring’ their horses—i.e., tie
them together by their head-ropes in a circle, heads inwards. They are
unable to lie down in comfort, which is of course a weak point, but it
does not often happen.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Marching.</em>—When the object to be attained was to cover as much
ground as possible it was found best to trot long stages, with walking
intervals between, when the men were made to dismount and lead. The
man should never be on his horse except when going faster than a walk.
It was found better to trot a good deal than to walk and lead even,
because the time saved by the faster pace gave the men and horses time
for an appreciable rest and for food while they were ‘off-saddled,’ which
should always be done when the enemy’s movements in any way
admit of it.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Shoeing.</em>—Each horse, in marching order, is supposed to carry one
complete set of shoes. If every man were trained to see constantly that
his horse’s shoes were on firm, a shoe ought seldom to be lost. If a
farrier is present, and the man has the necessary nails, a doubtful or loose
nail can be drawn and replaced, hence we made the rule that the men
should not carry spare shoes, but should carry nails, and we had the
farriers with us. Occasionally a horse lost a shoe when on detached duty,
but only then; and, after all, if the rider is careful, no serious damage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>should result. In any case, it is not worth while for every horse to carry
a complete set of shoes always, on the chance of one horse requiring one
shoe occasionally.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>The Usefulness of Followers</em> may be gathered to a certain extent from
the fact that none of the officers had chargers killed by anything but
bullets. Every officer had an Indian syce, and when a horse had had a
hard time it was found that one day marching with the syce restored
him. The follower has nothing to think about except to feed the horse
when he can, and it is wonderful what good one hour in a field of green
wheat or on a good bit of grass does for a tired and underfed animal;
besides, the follower often chances on a bundle or two of oat-straw or some
such luxury, and in any case the horse has plenty of time for grazing
during the delays of the march. The men latterly employed Kaffir
boys to a considerable extent, paying them wages out of their own
pockets. These Kaffirs received no rations, living on their masters’
leavings and occasional steaks out of dead horses. Taking all considerations
together, it would appear to be a saving to use the soldier as much
as possible for fighting purposes <em>only</em>, and to use native followers for all
work that does not entail fighting. Cooks and syces, even in small
numbers, would to a great extent ease the fighting man of arduous labour
which the follower could do just as well. We should have fewer cases of
sickness from want of rest and lack of time to cook properly if a few
native cooks accompanied each regiment. And a few syces might save
the lives of many horses that have to be neglected by the men when,
after a long march and perhaps a fight, they are ordered out on picket
directly they arrive in camp. The native is cheaper to feed and more
docile to manage, not minding things which Tommy hates—such
as cutting grass, for instance. His food is simple, and he can eat it
very comfortably going along the road, so that when he gets into
camp he is quite fit to go to work. I was told by an officer of the
Indian Transport train, who was with General Buller’s force in Natal,
that he had taken his corps with his native followers right through
to Belfast, and landed his animals there without a single casualty,
and not only well, but fat. He attributed it solely to the fact that the
servants understood their work and would unload without a murmur a
dozen times a day, and cut a heap of grass for every animal when they
got to camp. Why not employ the cheaper labourer, and save the dearer
for work that suits him better and which the follower cannot do? The
answer, I am aware, is that an armed transport man can help to defend
the convoy. This is of course true to a limited extent. Our transport
men never had a chance of firing a shot, and I think few had. All the
ox-waggons and mule-waggons were driven by Kaffirs, on the same grounds
as advocated, so why not apply the reasoning to other cases? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>argument in favour of the armed transport reminds one of the sportsman
who goes out armed with a gun, rifle, and pig-spear, ready for all
emergencies, but never has the right weapon in his hand when the game
springs up. The spare horse-shoes are another case of the same thing,
and there are many others. It is impossible to provide for every contingency.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Rations.</em>—In a general way the men’s rations were very good, but one
or two improvements suggest themselves. First, everyone who has tried
it knows that when spirits are not available the body acquires a great
craving for sugar, which is no doubt recognised, and hence the jam issue.
Chocolate is cheap, by which I mean light to carry, and is enormously
appreciated; but more important than anything appear to be the tea,
coffee, or cocoa rations, because, in a great measure, on the plentifulness
of these depends the amount or otherwise of many diseases, notably
enteric. No man will boil water and let it cool simply because he knows
it’s a healthy thing to do, but he will boil it to have a good drink of hot
tea. If you give him enough, he will have his drink before he goes to
bed, another in the morning, and he will also fill his water-bottle with
it. Half an ounce per man will accomplish this. I believe the amount
allowed per man in South Africa was ⅟<span class='small'>16</span> oz. By the time this had
been distributed in the dark, the ration became so small that half-a-dozen
men used to toss for the lot, in the hope that one at least would
get a good drink. Tea, moreover, is very light. An ox-waggon load is
4,000 lbs., which is 128,000 rations of ½ oz. each; which means that
4,000 men could be given ½ oz. of tea daily for a month, at the cost of one
ox-waggon added to the convoy. On our trek from Machadodorp to
Pretoria, we carried supplies for about 4,000 men for about a month, and
the convoy was many <em>miles</em> long, and I do not think that one ox-waggon
added thereto would have given any trouble.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Firing off Horseback.</em>—The value of this practice on occasions is another
of the lessons we might learn from the Boers. I do not pretend that the
shooting is accurate, yet it has a great moral advantage in certain
circumstances. Imagine yourself on a big rolling veldt doing rearguard.
The slopes are easy, and the ridges about 1,000 yards from crest to crest.
You hold one and the enemy the next. In order to keep your horses out
of fire they must be 200 yards or so away. All is well till you begin to
retire, but on rising you at once become visible to the Boer, who first of all
shoots at you, and then follows you up at a gallop to have a shot at you
before you can gain the next ridge. You retire in a hurry, run the risk
of being shot, and have the demoralising feeling that the enemy is
gaining rapidly on you and will ‘get at you’ before you gain the next ridge.
<em>But</em> leave near the ridge a few mounted men, place them back so far that
while they can see the Boer’s ridge, the enemy can only possibly see their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>heads and shoulders, and order your dismounted men to retire, crawling
at first, then stooping, and finally rising. They do this leisurely, as they
can see the mounted sentinels watching and they are reassured. These
sentinels have no fear, for they can at any time retire at a gallop, while the
enemy, hearing the firing, do not like advancing on an unknown number.
During the march from Machadodorp to Pretoria, this practice enabled
us to do in perfect comfort a rearguard duty which was considered by all
other corps very ‘nasty.’</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Suggestions with regard to raising Mounted Volunteer Corps in the
future.</em>—Besides the actual experiences of the fighting in South Africa,
there were one or two points in connection with the raising of the corps
itself, which came to my special notice in the course of my duties as
Adjutant and Quartermaster, the knowledge of which would, I think,
facilitate matters in the event of anyone raising another Volunteer corps
in India for active service.</p>

<p class='c023'>In my opinion the most important point of all is to make certain that
secrecy is maintained. Before any steps are taken for enrolling men, the
Adjutant and other officers from the Regular Army should be selected and
apportioned their work in connection with the raising of the corps. The
‘Regular’ N.C.O.s should be chosen, and the official scheme drawn up.
The first duty falls on the ‘office,’ and it should be properly organised in
every detail. Three or four rooms, Quartermaster’s store accommodation,
a shorthand writer, at least three or four competent clerks, as well as
mounted orderlies, are necessary. A camp pitched complete in every
detail should be ready to receive the men, especial attention being paid to
the provision of a temporary mess for the men as well as ‘dry’ and ‘wet’
canteens, and of a native food-shop for followers. This can all be done
‘confidentially.’ When the arrangements are complete, the intention to
raise the corps and the terms may be made public.</p>

<p class='c023'>If the fact of the raising of the corps had not leaked out, Government
would of course have made all the above suggested arrangements, and
things would have gone smoothly from the outset. As it was, every
Government official assisted Colonel Lumsden to his utmost power. As
a sample of this I may mention that, at their own request, the one
squadron of the 14th Bengal Lancers at Alipur supplied eight mounted
orderlies daily for six weeks, rendering invaluable assistance in carrying
letters. This same squadron marked out the camp for us, and lent their
<em>bunniahs’</em> (grain-sellers’) shops for the use of the swarm of servants who
came in attendance on the Volunteers. Another difficulty which it
would be good to avoid, if possible, was that under existing regulations
it was found to be impossible to attest the men until the day before
embarkation, so that for some weeks they were in camp and being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>trained without being under military law. Their good feeling alone
preserved discipline.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Regulars.</em>—A certain number of men who were specialists in various
lines, such as saddlers, farriers, signallers, and shoeing-smiths, together
with a sprinkling of non-commissioned officers, were lent to the corps
from the Regular Army, and they were of the greatest use to us. It is
essential that the selection of these be made with great care. There is
little doubt that the gentleman Volunteer is not always easy to get on
with, so that the Regular should be a man of character and tact. When
called upon for men, Commanding Officers send fully qualified men, but
have a tendency to ‘give a man a chance’ in novel circumstances.
Unless a Regular is a tactful, good fellow, he is unlikely to be of much
use with Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Selection of Horses.</em>—As far as we could learn from our experience in
South Africa, the three main points in the selection of a horse are:
(1) hardiness, (2) true action, (3) ‘good doing’; while for convenience
in mounting and dismounting he should not be over fifteen hands high.
Comparative slowness, light legs, and slight unsteadiness do not seem to
matter, but he must be hardy, he must be clear of any suspicion whatever
of brushing, and he must be the sort likely to ‘live on sticks and stones.’
The work is all very slow, but it is continuous. There were practically
no cases of lameness from sprains, or indeed of anything except ‘brushing,’
and after a month’s work, the horse which could go the furthest and fastest
was the one that kept the best condition. One of the horses that did the
best work in the corps was a little Boer pony of Private Graham’s, which
was only about twelve hands high. As transport animals, our little
‘Bhootia’ ponies did most excellently, and were better than mules, in that
while they were quite as hardy, they were heavier and more game.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Shipping Horses.</em>—At Calcutta the quays are only a few feet above
the water-level, and as the horses all have to be put on the upper and
main decks, the custom is to ‘sling’ them on board by means of cranes
and tackle attached to belly-bands. I saw a whole ship being laden with
horses in this way. The operation took one entire day and cost five rupees
per horse. One horse at least was dropped and had to be destroyed,
a large proportion suffered injuries, and all were terrified. On meeting
the officer in charge afterwards, I learnt that hardly any of the horses
would feed at all for a day at least. For us the authorities erected a
zigzag gangway by the aid of which 200 horses were put on board
without accident in one hour and a half. Moreover, the gangway could
not have cost 100<em>l</em>. Communication gangways between the decks were
also fitted up, thus enabling us to transfer horses from one deck to
another, and these proved very valuable in dealing with sick cases during
the voyage.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span><em>Horse Standings.</em>—Once on the ship each horse had a stall in a row,
each stall being just big enough for a horse to stand in, and surrounded
by a four-foot rail. On the floor-boards were fixed four strong battens, two
inches square in cross section, at intervals of eighteen inches. The horse’s
fore feet fell naturally on to the first batten and his hind feet on to the
last. He was thus forced to stand always in a constrained position. For
my own horses I had the battens otherwise distributed, putting one six
inches from either end and one in the middle. The fore feet came
naturally behind the first batten and the hind feet before the rear one,
while the middle one did not interfere with the horse’s position, and was
only used by the horse when necessitated by bad weather. It was, I think,
a great improvement. This was not my idea, but was what the Australian
horse ‘shippers’ recommend and use.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Shoes.</em>—The orders in the Service are that all horses go on board
shod, which is contrary to the custom of the big Australian shipping
firms, who say that shod horses slip up when it is rough. We had no
rough weather, and so could not prove this, but owing to the shoe keeping
the foot off the constantly damp boards, the feet of our horses were, on
arrival, in infinitely better condition than those of the horses brought over
by Australian ‘shippers’ to India.</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Exercising Horses on Board Ship.</em>—This is, I learn, never done, but we
gave the idea a trial, and it turned out to be quite practicable. Our ship
was a very small one, and we had some difficulty about space for exercise
ground. However, we found three places in different parts of the ship
where we could get a small circle. Matting was put down, to prevent
slipping, and it was found that on each of these ten horses could be led
at a time, one behind the other. In this manner we managed to give
every horse half an hour a day of walking exercise. While these ten
horses were out, the next ten had twice as much room to stand in, which
enabled the men to give them half-an-hour’s grooming. It was very
noticeable how the legs ‘fined’ with the exercise, and it must have been
a great relief to the horse. Our horses landed in very good condition, and,
except for being soft, they were fit to go to work at once. It is obviously
only possible to exercise horses like this when you have a large number
of hands as we had.</p>

<p class='c048'>Following are the recommendations made by Lieutenant-Colonel
Lumsden, late commanding Lumsden’s Horse, in bringing the
names of the undermentioned officers and men to the favourable
notice of Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief,
as having done special and meritorious work during the service
of his corps in South Africa. The promotions or honours given
subsequently are placed within parentheses.</p>

<p class='c023'>Previous to the date of these recommendations, Major
Chamney had been gazetted a Companion of St. Michael and
St. George, while Captain Rutherfoord and Lieutenant Pugh
had received the decoration of the Distinguished Service Order.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Captain N.C. Taylor</span>, <em>14th Bengal Lancers</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This gentleman filled the post of adjutant (difficult in a corps like
mine) with great judgment, and fulfilled his arduous duties to my entire
satisfaction. He behaved splendidly under fire on many trying occasions,
displayed great coolness and self-reliance, and proved himself a dashing
and able leader, and was of much service to me throughout the campaign.

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Captain L.H. Noblett</span>, <em>Royal Irish Rifles</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In command of B Company Lumsden’s Horse. I cannot speak too
highly of this gentleman as a leader of Mounted Infantry. His services
to me from the raising of the corps until its disbandment were invaluable—clear-headed
and cool in any circumstances; and the way he handled
his men in action won their unbounded confidence and mine. To raise
or lead a corps of Mounted Infantry I know no one I would sooner
select. (Brevet Major.)</p>

immense trouble and interest in his company from start to finish, displaying
much tact in handling his men, with whom he was a great
favourite. As a soldier I can only say his long and honourable record
added herewith speaks for itself. (Brevet Major.)</p>

he also displayed much coolness in attending to some cavalrymen
who were wounded, also under fire. I consider him fully deserving of
honourable mention. (Mention in despatches.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In my recommendations for honourable mention I feel I must particularise
Corporal Graves and Sergeant Fraser, of the Bank of Bengal.
They rendered me invaluable service as orderly-room clerk and paymaster
respectively, besides rendering excellent service in the field. To carry out
efficiently both duties was no light measure, and on our arrival at Cape
Town I was complimented by the Pay Department as the only corps
which had come down with its pay-sheets up to date, all credit for which
is due to the above-named gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remaining four named have all done meritorious work throughout
the campaign, and are extremely deserving of the honour I am soliciting
for them.</p>

    <div>REGULAR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following non-commissioned officers lent from the Regulars did
excellent work with me throughout the campaign, and I have much
pleasure in mentioning them:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <span class='sc'>Sergeant Hewitt</span>, of the Royal Irish Rifles, acted as Company
Sergeant-Major to B Company until November 1900, when he was
made Regimental Sergeant-Major, in succession to Sergeant-Major
Marsham, who then vacated the post for a commission in the South
African Constabulary. He had also acted temporarily as Regimental
Sergeant-Major from May 1 to September 1. He showed much tact
throughout, and was of the greatest possible assistance to the Adjutant;
and I can strongly recommend him for any similar appointment. He
was most popular with all members of the corps from the raising of the
same to its disbandment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>2. <span class='sc'>Staff-Sergeant Stephens</span>, of the Indian Transport, was with
the corps throughout the war. It is impossible to over-estimate the
assistance given by him. He was in direct command of the whole of
the regimental transport and carried out his duties with skill, energy,
tact, and determination. He was most popular with his Volunteer
drivers, and managed them with great credit.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <span class='sc'>Farrier-Sergeant Marshall</span>, 54th Battery Royal Field Artillery,
was in subordinate charge of the horse hospital throughout the
war, and performed his duties most satisfactorily. He was especially
tactful with Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <span class='sc'>Sergeant Brennan</span>, of the York and Lancaster Regiment, was
always capable, willing, obliging, and uniformly well behaved. He took
his position where wanted in any capacity without a murmur, and, at
various times, filled the posts of Company Sergeant-Major, Company
Quartermaster-Sergeant, Regimental Sergeant-Major, and Regimental
Quartermaster-Sergeant. He also displayed much tact in dealing with
Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Briggs</span>, <span class='sc'>Cuthbert</span>, and <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>, shoeing-smiths, of the 15th Hussars,
did their work well and willingly from start to finish. They also worked
well with the Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Signallers <span class='sc'>Lance-Corporal Lee</span>, of the York and Lancaster Regiment,
Privates <span class='sc'>Lowe</span>, <span class='sc'>Longman</span>, and <span class='sc'>Hayward</span>, of the 3rd Hussars, did
good and useful work for the brigade, but were almost invariably
detached from the corps and placed on special service. From the end
of May to the end of November they were with General Sir Ian
Hamilton, only rejoining when my corps returned to Bloemfontein.
While with me they were in every way satisfactory.</p>

    <div><em>To the Editor of the ‘Indian Daily News.’</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—May I ask you to be good enough to publish for the benefit of
the subscribers to the Indian Mounted Infantry Corps (Lumsden’s Horse)
Fund a detailed account of the receipts and expenditure?</p>

<p class='c000'>On behalf of myself, officers, and men of the corps, I desire to tender
our grateful acknowledgment to His Excellency Lord Curzon, Honorary
Colonel, not only for having sanctioned the raising of the corps and for
his patronage, but also for the very material assistance he graciously gave
us and for the interest he took in our operations on active service.</p>

<p class='c000'>I take the opportunity, at the completion of our campaign, again to
thank the public for the splendid manner in which they equipped the
corps for active service in South Africa and for the cordial way they
welcomed it back again. The public appreciation of their services to the
Army has been to the officers and men of Lumsden’s Horse ample recompense
for any hardships they may have endured. For myself I can only
repeat that I never wish to be associated with more gallant comrades. I am
indebted to General Sir E.R. Elles, Adjutant-General, General Gaselee,
Quartermaster-General, Surgeon-General Harvey, Director-General
I.M.S., and General Wace, Director-General of Ordnance, for the
assistance given in obtaining equipment for the corps and facilitating its
despatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>More than special thanks are also due to Sir Patrick Playfair for the
great interest he has taken in the corps from start to finish, as well as to
the other members of the committee.—Yours, &amp;c.,</p>

</div>

<p class='c058'>The following article is by Sergeant Stephens, of the Indian
Commissariat and Transport Department, attached to Lumsden’s
Horse:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c000'>The Government of India at the last moment not sanctioning native
drivers for the corps, fifty Europeans had to be enlisted under the same
terms as those of trackers, receiving kit, equipment, &amp;c. As there was no
time to pick and choose, the men were taken, if physically fit, more by personal
appearances than recommendations. With the exception of a few,
they worked remarkably well and never complained of the hardships they
had to endure while we were in South Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>When each member joined the corps he was handed over a pair of
ponies or mules, also harness for same, with cart complete. The majority of
them had never driven or ridden a horse in their lives, so that the breaking-in
of horses and men was not an easy task. Of fifty pairs of animals
received for draught purposes not a pair was broken to harness, and when
the heavy breechen was placed on their backs they did their best to kick it
off, but the girths supplied by Government were strong enough to keep
that in place. Our next difficulty was to put them together in carts.
Immediately the curricle bar or iron support rested on their backs they
wanted to be off for their lives, and in some instances got away and did a
lot of mischief before they came to grief, cart and all. Privates Hyde
and Braine once trying to stop a pair got severely hurt; Hyde putting
his shoulder out, while Braine got his head badly cut. Both were sent
to the General Hospital for treatment, but recovered in time to join
B Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Transport men were very willing, took a delight in their duty,
and worked hard from 7 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> daily, and at that rate we were
able to have the worst of the animals broken to harness before we left
Calcutta. At the same time, the men were improving daily in the care
and treatment of animals, and when the General Officer Commanding
held his inspection, every one of them was able to drive, or seemed to think
he could, so we had A Company’s Transport out for inspection. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>inspecting carts, animals, and drivers, the General expressed himself
pleased with the very ready way in which they had been got in order,
and stated that he thought we should get on well in Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men had not the slightest idea of what a muleteer was until they
got on board ship. Then the work started, and dirty work it was for
about two hours every morning. Even then there were no complaints.
The officer commanding the corps and the captain of the ship gave great
praise to the Transport men every day for having the cleanest deck. The
captain afterwards said that with Regular troops he had never seen it
better kept. They had to perform the same duties as the troopers, the
only difference being that they had extra work daily from 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> to 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
dubbing and cleaning harness.</p>

<p class='c000'>While on board ship the Transport of A Company was divided into
four sections, consequently four non-commissioned officers had to be
made. This was the first promotion in the Transport, and was given to
those who seemed to take most interest in their work. The names of
men promoted were Power, Palmer, Cullen, and Estabrooke. Power
afterwards worked up to sergeant, was a very good non-commissioned
officer throughout, and quite deserved the rank he held. Work on board
ship was the same daily, nothing fresh occurring till we landed at Cape
Town. That night carts had to be got ready, and the following morning
we had to take our own baggage to Maitland Camp. That was about the
worst day we had while in Africa. It was impossible to look to our front—animals
would not face the sand-storms—it was not sand, but small
stones beating against our faces, and our eyes were sore for weeks after our
first day at the Cape. It was very hard to harness the Transport animals
in carts; but after being about twenty-six days on board ship, they had not
much mind for bolting that first day. The camp, when we got there, was
knee-deep in sand. Maitland at that time was a dirty hole, and we were
pleased when we got our orders to shift. But a few things happened
during our stay there which we cannot forget. The Government came on
us, thinking we had too many carts, and they had to be reduced by ten.
So we handed our ten carts and ten pairs of ponies to the Transport
Officer, Cape Town, and, instead of them, got thirty-eight pairs of mules,
with leader harness complete, to act as leaders for our remaining carts.
That meant instead of two ponies to a cart, as we left India, we had to
put four ponies or mules. This complicated matters a long time, for some
of the drivers could never manage four-in-hand, so had to be left with a
pair only. They said that two ‘donkeys’ (which they would insist upon
calling their chargers) were quite enough for them to look after. In the
end, everything turned out very well. We kept those animals spare, and
whenever any in the teams showed signs of fatigue, got lame, or otherwise
unfit, we had others to take their places.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>The Transport Officer at the Cape did not think much of his bargain.
He could not get the Cape boys to make head or tail of our Indian carts
and harness. It was harder for them to put a pair of our ponies in their
cart than their own span of ten, which they could use as they liked.</p>

<p class='c000'>After receiving orders for the front with a light heart, every man
thought the minutes too long until he got an opportunity of distinguishing
himself. We were ordered to Bloemfontein, and everybody was on the
war-path at once. We railed to that station, which did not do the animals
any good, and on arrival there were ordered to join a brigade at Deel’s
Farm, about three miles beyond the town. Having to draw our stores
from Bloemfontein station prepared our transport and drivers for the
work which lay before them, and during our stay there they got in
excellent order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first day our Transport carts went out with spare ammunition for
the corps, nothing unusual occurred, and, in fact, all returned disappointed,
but this showed the ammunition drivers what they must expect when
going out again. All in charge of these carts were picked men, being the
best drivers with the best animals. They had to canter and trot over
rough country with eight boxes of ammunition, to keep in touch with
their corps, over hills or otherwise, and be always where they were
wanted; our carts were very handy, and could go where others failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day was the well-remembered Ospruit fight, and the carts
had a narrow escape then. The enemy got their range, and the pom-poms
played round them for some time, a few of the shells landing
between the carts; but the drivers were just as easy as ever, and when
ordered to retire did it in excellent style, smoking and passing jokes as
the shells followed them up. Private Lowther, who was on stretcher-bearer’s
duty that day, will not forget what he called a cool order. When
the drivers were getting out of range one of their hats was blown off, and
Lowther, being on foot, was ordered to pick it up. He looked twice, but
went back and got it. Shells were a bit thick, but he remembered he
was a soldier. The day after the fight we had to send a cart out to bring
in Major Showers. Corporal Cullen and Private Arthurton went with it
on duty, Cullen corporal in charge, Arthurton the driver. After finding
the Major’s body, they were joined by some Boers, who assisted to put the
Major in the cart, had a friendly chat with them, passed cigarettes and
tobacco round, and Cullen said when he came back to camp that there
were very few Boers among them, nearly all English-speaking and of a
very respectable class. They had very little to say regarding the fight
the previous day, but said they were sorry our Colonel was killed. They
had found some papers in the pockets of young Lumsden, whom they
took to be the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had most trouble with our carts and animals when night marching.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>The ponies were excellent for draught purposes; the Cape mules did not
last nearly as well. If properly fed the ponies would have worked throughout
our stay in Africa; but they were often days without anything but
what they could pick when we got an hour’s halt. On one occasion
which I remember well they were thirty-six hours under harness without
food of any kind, and only watered once. People might say, Why not
oftener? Water was not procurable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another thing that came against us was the cunning Kaffir. He
could walk around at night, take the best of our animals, and have them
disfigured in such a way that nobody could recognise them the following
morning. We put up with this for a long time, until our stock of spare
mules ran short, and then we had to carry out the same tricks as the
remainder by doing unto others as they had done to us. We were able
to take to Pretoria every one of the carts with which we left Bloemfontein.
When we got there, everything, of course, was the worse for wear, but
complete in every other respect. If anything ever frightened our Transport
drivers it was the word ‘drift.’ You should have seen their worried
looks when they heard that there was a drift ahead; but they braved
everything, thinking that Pretoria would finish all. But to our surprise
when we got there we found out that the show was only then
starting. We had a little rest after the surrender, being sent to a
station ten miles off called Irene. While there the Transport kept the
horses of the corps well fed on oat-hay, which we brought from all
the farms within ten miles of the place. We remained at Irene until
August 1, and then got attached to a brigade going after De Wet
in the Rustenburg direction. We were on this march for twenty-eight
days without rest, which was the cause of killing all our Indian
ponies except twelve. The whole of that month’s march was a dead
pull for the Transport—some days it was up to the ankle in sand, while
next it was just the same in black sticky earth. We were not the only
lot that suffered; every unit experienced just the same. It took us all our
time to get our carts back to Pretoria. At the end of August we were only
a day in Pretoria before being ordered off again on the march to Barberton.
Things had to be got ready as quickly as possible, and off we went on
September 1 for another long trek. When starting on this march we
had to leave twelve of our carts in Pretoria, and as many men of the
corps had come down we reduced our Transport. During the whole of
this period we had very little time for carrying out repairs to carts and
harness. The saddles began to give out in the leather, as they had not
been repaired since we left Calcutta except a stitch here and there.
During our stay in Africa we never had an animal suffer from sore back.
This, we think, was due to the excellent way in which the saddles were
stuffed before leaving Calcutta. Although newly received from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Ordnance Department, they did not satisfy the Commissariat and Transport
Sergeant-Major, who had them stuffed to his own liking.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the march to Barberton and back we had very bad weather, which
completely destroyed our gear, and, arriving at Pretoria for the third time,
we thought of getting it thoroughly repaired. We had done our best,
and, in fact, had all the saddles restuffed and lined in a very short time,
when orders were received for the corps to be disbanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of animals with which we left India was—Ponies, 100;
mules, 5; total, 105. The five mules lasted throughout, but only eight
ponies lived to see the finish. Two of these, driven by Private Arthurton,
seemed to be in better condition at the finish than when they left
Calcutta. He took great care of his animals. Two others were in charge
of Driver Estabrooke. As he intended remaining in South Africa, the
Colonel presented him with his pair.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the carts and gear were handed over to the Ordnance,
Pretoria, before our departure, with three hearty cheers from Lumsden’s
muleteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Errors in the text have been corrected where they can be reasonably
attributed to the printer or editor, or where the same word appears as
expected elsewhere. Inconsistencies in punctuation, particularly in the
Index, have been resolved.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the very long table of cash contributions in Appendix VII, the ‘Carried
Forward’ subtotals at the foot and head of each page have been removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Appendices II and X, wide tables have been divided into rearranged
in order to be more readily viewable in this media.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book was printed with a short errata slip inserted prior to p. 1, which
has been moved to the end of the text, prior to the Index. The changes have
<em>not</em> been made, but are presented here <span class='htmlonly'>using a mouse-over insert</span>
as <ins class='correction' title='Grobler’s (errata)'>Grobelaar’s</ins>. The error noted on p. 384,
line <a href='#corr384.13'>13</a>, for ‘E.J. Johnstone’ apparently had already been corrected, but
as ‘C.H.M. Johnstone’ rather than 'Johnstone, C.H.'. The text is given as
printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large foldout map of the South African campaign, with its accompanying legend, was
bound inside the end cover. The legend has been removed from that image and is
given here in tabular form, which should make it more useful. <span class='htmlonly'>A full-size
version of that map, as well as that on p. <a href='#i145'>145</a>, can be viewed by clicking on the image.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Footnotes in the text have been renumbered consecutively for consecutively. They
have been gathered at the end of the text. Footnotes in the tabular matter in the
Appendices have been sequenced as letters A through G, and follow the table to
which they pertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Corrections made to the text appear underlined as <ins class='correction' title='original'>corrected</ins> text.

<p class='c000'>In the list of men gazetted to the Regular Army on p. <a href='#Page_365'>365</a>, 'Norton' would seem to
be A.E. Norton, of the West India Regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Index reference for Captain Chamney, indicating p. 379, is incorrect. This
probably refers to p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>, where the Captain is mentioned.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
